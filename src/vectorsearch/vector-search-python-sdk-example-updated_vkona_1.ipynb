It is one of the country's three [[Capital (political)|capital cities]], serving as the executive (administrative) and de facto national capital ([[Cape Town]] is the [[legislature|legislative]] capital and [[Bloemfontein]] the [[judicial]] capital). Pretoria is the central part of the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]] which was formed by the amalgamation of several former local authorities including  [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]] and [[Soshanguve]]). There have been proposals to change the name of Pretoria itself to Tshwane, and the [[Pretoria#Change of name|proposed name change]] has caused some controversy.  Pretoria is named after the [[Voortrekker]] leader [[Andries Pretorius]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Raper|first=Peter E.|title=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names|url=http://archive.org/stream/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames/SaPlaceNames#page/n373/mode/2up|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=28 August 2013|page=373|year=1987}}</ref> and within South Africa is popularly known as the Jacaranda City due to the thousands of [[Jacaranda]] trees planted in its streets, parks and gardens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/provinces.htm#gauteng |title=South Africa's provinces: Gauteng |accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>  ==History== [[File:Pretorius.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue of Andries Wilhelmus Jacobus Pretorius (27 November 1798 – 23 July 1853) in Pretoria]] <div style=\"float:right;clear:right;\"> [[File:Union-buildings-pretoria.JPG|thumb|The [[Union Buildings]], seat of South Africa's government]] [[File:Palace of Justice - Pretoria.jpg|thumb|The Palace of Justice]] [[File:RSA Pretoria 2.jpg|thumb|Old Counsel Chambers or the \"Raadsaal\" of the ZAR]]</div>  Pretoria was founded in 1855 by [[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius|Marthinus Pretorius]], a leader of the [[Voortrekkers]], who named it after his father [[Andries Pretorius]] and chose a spot on the banks of the \"Apies rivier\" ([[Afrikaans]] for \"Monkeys river\") to be the new [[capital city|capital]] of the [[South African Republic]](Z.A.R.). The elder Pretorius had become a national hero of the [[Voortrekkers]] after his victory over the [[Dingane]] and the [[Zulu people|Zulus]] in the [[Battle of Blood River]]. [[Andries Pretorius]] also negotiated the [[Sand River Convention]] (1852), in which Britain acknowledged the independence of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. It became the capital of the [[South African Republic]] (ZAR) on 1 May 1860. The founding of Pretoria as the capital of the South African Republic can be seen as marking the end of the Boers' settlement movements of the [[Great Trek]].  ===Boer Wars=== {{Main|Boer Wars}} {{See also|Pretoria Forts}} During the [[First Boer War]], the city was besieged by Republican forces in December 1880 and March 1881. The peace treaty which ended the war was signed in Pretoria on 3 August 1881 at the [[Pretoria Convention]].  The [[Second Boer War]] (1899 to 1902) resulted in the end of the [[Transvaal Republic]] and start of British [[hegemony]] in South Africa. During the war, [[Winston Churchill]] was imprisoned in the [[Staats Model School]] in Pretoria but escaped to [[Mozambique]]. The city surrendered to British forces under [[Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Frederick Roberts]] on 5 June 1900 and the conflict was ended in Pretoria with the signing of the [[Peace of Vereeniging]] on 31 May 1902.  The [[Pretoria Forts]] were built for the defence of the city just prior to the Second Boer War. Though some of these forts are today in ruins, a number of them have been preserved as national monuments.  ===Union of South Africa=== {{Main|Union of South Africa}} The Boer Republics of the ZAR and the [[Orange River Colony]] were united with the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and [[Natal Colony]] in 1910 to become the [[Union of South Africa]]. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital. Between 1910 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. (As the capital of the ZAR, Pretoria had superseded [[Potchefstroom]] in that role.)  On 14 October 1931, Pretoria achieved official city status.<ref>South African History Online, [http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/pretoria-receives-city-status], 2011]</ref> When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria remained its administrative capital.  ==Geography== [[File:Pretoria, RSA from above.PNG|thumb|left|Satellite image of Pretoria.]] Pretoria is situated approximately {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of [[Johannesburg]] in the northeast of South Africa, in a transitional belt between the plateau of the [[Highveld]] to the south and the lower-lying [[Bushveld]] to the north. It lies at an altitude of about {{convert|1,339|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]],<ref>[http://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm ''Elevation Finder - freemaptools.com'', Elevation of the City Hall in Pretoria, 4 July 2014]</ref> in a warm, sheltered, fertile valley, surrounded by the hills of the [[Magaliesberg]] range. [[File:Magaliesberg08.jpg|thumb|The City is surrounded by the Magaliesberg Mountain range.]]  ===Climate=== The city has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with long hot rainy summers and short cool to cold,dry winters. The city experiences the typical winters of South Africa with cold, clear nights and mild to moderately warm days. Although the average lows during winter are mild it can get bitterly cold due to the clear skies and this in recent years have caused Pretoria to experience temperatures in the range of 2C to -5C at night.The average annual temperature is {{convert|18.7|°C|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate data, 30-year climate average 1979–2008, Goddard Institute of Space Studies</ref> This is rather high considering its relatively high altitude of about 1339 metres and is due mainly to its sheltered valley position, which acts as a heat trap and cuts it off from cool southerly and south-easterly air masses for much of the year. Rain is chiefly concentrated in the summer months, with drought conditions prevailing over the winter months, when frosts may be sharp. Snowfall is an extremely rare event; snowflakes were spotted in 1959, 1968 and 2012 in the city, but the city has never experienced an accumulation in its history. During a nationwide heatwave in November 2011, Pretoria experienced temperatures that reached {{convert|39|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, unusual for that time of the year. Similar record-breaking extreme heat events also occurred in January 2013, when Pretoria experienced temperatures exceeding {{convert|37|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} on several days. The all-time high recorded in Pretoria was {{convert|42|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} on 25 January 2013. The year 2014 saw one of the wettest years on record for the city. A total of {{convert|914|mm|0|abbr=on}} fell up to end December with {{convert|220|mm|0|abbr=on}} recorded in this month alone.  {{Weather box |location = Pretoria |metric first = Yes |single line = Yes |Jan record high C = 42 |Feb record high C = 37 |Mar record high C = 35 |Apr record high C = 33 |May record high C = 29 |Jun record high C = 25 |Jul record high C = 26 |Aug record high C = 31 |Sep record high C = 37 |Oct record high C = 39 |Nov record high C = 39 |Dec record high C = 37 |year record high C = 42 |Jan high C = 29 |Feb high C = 28 |Mar high C = 27 |Apr high C = 24 |May high C = 22 |Jun high C = 19 |Jul high C = 20 |Aug high C = 22 |Sep high C = 26 |Oct high C = 27 |Nov high C = 27 |Dec high C = 28 |year high C = 25 |Jan mean C = 23.5 |Feb mean C = 22.5 |Mar mean C = 21.5 |Apr mean C = 18 |May mean C = 15 |Jun mean C = 12 |Jul mean C = 12.5 |Aug mean C = 15 |Sep mean C = 19 |Oct mean C = 20.5 |Nov mean C = 21.5 |Dec mean C = 22.5 |year mean C = 18.6 |Jan low C = 18 |Feb low C = 17 |Mar low C = 16 |Apr low C = 12 |May low C = 8 |Jun low C = 5 |Jul low C = 5 |Aug low C = 8 |Sep low C = 12 |Oct low C = 14 |Nov low C = 16 |Dec low C = 17 |year low C = 12 |Jan record low C = 8 |Feb record low C = 11 |Mar record low C = 6 |Apr record low C = 3 |May record low C = -1 |Jun record low C = -6 |Jul record low C = -4 |Aug record low C = -1 |Sep record low C = 2 |Oct record low C = 4 |Nov record low C = 7 |Dec record low C = 7 |year record low C = -6 |Jan precipitation mm = 154 |Feb precipitation mm = 75 |Mar precipitation mm = 82 |Apr precipitation mm = 51 |May precipitation mm = 13 |Jun precipitation mm = 7 |Jul precipitation mm = 3 |Aug precipitation mm = 6 |Sep precipitation mm = 22 |Oct precipitation mm = 71 |Nov precipitation mm = 98 |Dec precipitation mm = 150 |year precipitation mm = 733 |Jan precipitation days = 14 |Feb precipitation days = 11 |Mar precipitation days = 10 |Apr precipitation days = 7 |May precipitation days = 3 |Jun precipitation days = 1 |Jul precipitation days = 1 |Aug precipitation days = 2 |Sep precipitation days = 3 |Oct precipitation days = 9 |Nov precipitation days = 12 |Dec precipitation days = 15 |year precipitation days = 87 |Jan sun = 261 |Feb sun = 235 |Mar sun = 254 |Apr sun = 246 |May sun = 283 |Jun sun = 271 |Jul sun = 289 |Aug sun = 296 |Sep sun = 284 |Oct sun = 275 |Nov sun = 254 |Dec sun = 272 |year sun = 3220 |source 1 = South African Weather Service<ref name=\"saws-climstats\">{{cite web |url = http://old.weathersa.co.za/Climat/Climstats/PretoriaStats.jsp |title = Climate data for Pretoria |accessdate = 6 March 2010 |publisher=South African Weather Service|date=June 2011}}</ref> |date=August 2010 |source 2 = The Weather Network (sun only) <ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.theweathernetwork.com/statistics/c01861 |title = Climate Statistics for Pretoria, South Africa |accessdate = 24 March 2012}}</ref> }}  ==Demographics== [[File:Tshwane population density map.svg|thumb|Population density in and around Pretoria {{Columns |col1 = {{legend|#ffffcc|&lt;1 /km²}} {{legend|#ffeda0|1–3 /km²}} {{legend|#fed976|3–10 /km²}} {{legend|#feb24c|10–30 /km²}} {{legend|#fd8d3c|30–100 /km²}} |col2= {{legend|#fc4e2a|100–300 /km²}} {{legend|#e31a1c|300–1000 /km²}} {{legend|#bc0026|1000–3000 /km²}} {{legend|#800026|&gt;3000 /km²}}}}]] [[File:Tshwane dominant language map.svg|thumb|right|Geographical distribution of home languages in Pretoria {{Columns |col1= {{legend|#8dd3c7|[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]}} {{legend|#ffffb3|[[South African English|English]]}} {{legend|#bebada|[[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]}} {{legend|#80b1d3|[[Zulu language|Zulu]]}} |col2= {{legend|#fdb462|[[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]]}} {{legend|#fccde5|[[Tswana language|Tswana]]}} {{legend|#ffed6f|[[Tsonga language|Tsonga]]}} {{legend|#d0d0d0|None dominant}}}}]] Depending on the extent of the area understood to constitute \"Pretoria\", the population ranges from 500,000<ref>Population, according to the 2001 Census, of the [http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/77612 Pretoria \"main place\"].</ref> to 2.95&nbsp;million.<ref>Population, according to the [http://www.statssa.gov.za/Publications/P03011/P030112007.pdf 2007 Community Survey], of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality after the 2011 annexation of the Metsweding District Municipality.</ref> The main language spoken in Pretoria is [[Afrikaans]]; also widely spoken are [[Pedi language|Pedi]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Setswana language|Tswana]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and English. The city of Pretoria has the largest white population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since its founding it has been a major [[Afrikaner]] population centre, and currently there are roughly 1 million Afrikaners living in or around the city.  Even since the end of Apartheid, Pretoria itself still has a white majority, albeit an ever increasing black middle-class. However, in the townships of [[Soshanguve]] and [[Atteridgeville]] blacks make up close to all of the population. The largest white ethnic group are the Afrikaners and the largest black ethnic group are the [[Northern Sotho people|Northern Sotho]]s.  The lower estimate for the population of Pretoria includes largely former white-designated areas and there is therefore a white majority. However, including the geographically separate townships increases Pretoria's population beyond a million and makes whites a minority.  Pretoria's [[Indian South Africans|Indians]] were ordered to move from Pretoria to [[Laudium]] on 6 June 1958.<ref>[http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/transfer-indian-community-pretoria-laudium-ordered South African History Online]</ref>  ==Cityscape==  ===Architecture=== {{See also|Pretoria Forts}} :''{{Commons category-inline||bullet=none|Buildings in Pretoria}}''  Pretoria has over the years had very diverse cultural influences and this is reflected in the architectural styles that can be found in the city. It ranges from 19th century Dutch, German and British Colonial Architecture to [[Modern architecture|modern]], [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], [[neomodern]], and [[Art Deco|art deco]] architecture styles with a good mix of a uniquely South African style.  Some of the notable structures in Pretoria include the late 19th century [[Palace of Justice (South Africa)|Palace of Justice]], the early 20th century [[Union Buildings]], the post-war [[Voortrekker Monument]], the diverse buildings dotting the main campuses of both the [[University of Pretoria]] and the [[University of South Africa]], traditional [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch]] style [[Mahlamba Ndlopfu]] (the President's House), the more modern Reserve Bank of South Africa (Office skyscraper) and the Telkom Lukas Rand Transmission Tower. Other well-known structures and buildings include the [[Loftus Versfeld Stadium]], The South African [[State Theatre, South Africa|State Theatre]] and the Oliver Tambo building which is the Headquarters of the [[Department of International Relations and Cooperation]] (which is a good example of neomodern architecture in South Africa). <gallery> File:Union_Buildings_Eastern_Wing.jpg|The Eastern Wing of the Union Buildings |A typical streetscape in 'The Jacaranda City' File:Fort Klapperkop.jpg|[[Pretoria Forts|Fort Klapperkop]] File:Neomodernist facade in Pretoria.JPG|[[Neomodern]] architecture in Pretoria File:9 2 258 0013-Law Chambers-Palace of Justice-Pretoria-s.jpg| The Palace of Justice | Brooklyn Bridge in eastern Pretoria File:Jacarandas smaller picture.png| The Jacaranda lined streets of Pretoria </gallery>  ===Central business district=== [[File:Skyline-of-pretoria.jpg|thumb|The Central Business District]] [[File:Pta zoo.jpg|thumb|The view from the Pretoria Zoo cable car ride]] Despite the many corporate offices, small businesses, shops and government departments that are situated in [[List of Pretoria suburbs|Pretoria's sprawling suburbs]], its Central Business District still retains its status as the traditional centre of government and commerce. Many banks, businesses, large corporations, shops, shopping centres and other businesses are situated in the city centre which is towered by several large skyscrapers, the tallest of which is the Poyntons Building (110m tall), the ABSA Building (132 m tall) and the Reserve Bank of South Africa building (150m tall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/southafricanreservebankbuilding-pretoria-southafrica |title=South African Reserve Bank Building, Pretoria &#124; Building 103551 |location=Pretoria / |publisher=Emporis |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref>  The area contains a large amount of historical buildings, monuments and museums that include the [[Pretoria City Hall]], Pretorius Square, Church Square (Along with its many historical buildings and statues) and the [[Ou Raadsaal]]. There is also the Transvaal Museum (the country's leading natural history museum, which although it has changed venues a number of times, has been around since 1892), the [[National Zoological Gardens of South Africa]] (or more colloquially known as the Pretoria Zoo), [[Melrose House]] Museum in Jacob Maré Street, the [[Pretoria Art Museum]] and the National Cultural History Museum.  Several National Departments also have Head Offices in the Central Business district such as the Department of Health, Basic Education, Transport, Higher Education and Training, Sport and Recreation, Justice and Constitutional Development, Public Service and Administration, Water and Environmental Affairs and the National Treasury. The district also has a high number of residential buildings which house people who primarily work in the district.  ===Parks and gardens=== Pretoria is home to the [[National Zoological Gardens of South Africa]] as well as the [[Pretoria National Botanical Garden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sa-venues.com/national-botanical-gardens.htm|title=National Botanical Gardens|publisher=SA-Venues|accessdate=12 September 2008}}</ref> There are also a number of smaller parks and gardens located throughout the city, including the [[Austin Roberts]] Bird Sanctuary, Pretorius Square gardens, the Pretoria [[Rosarium]], [[Church Square, Pretoria|Church Square]], [[Pretoria Showgrounds]],[[Springbok Park]], [[Freedom Park (South Africa)|Freedom Park]], and [[Burgers Park]], the oldest park in the city and now a national monument. In the suburbs there are also several parks that are notable: Rietondale Park, \"Die Proefplaas\" in the Queenswood suburb, Nelson Mandel Park and Mandela Park Peace Garden and Belgrave Square Park.  ==Suburbs== {{Main|List of Pretoria suburbs}}  ==Transport== [[File:Pretoria streetsign.jpg|thumb|Street signs in Pretoria]] [[File:Gautrain-in-depot-retouched.JPG|thumb|[[Gautrain]]]] [[File:Blue Train passes through the Karoo.jpg|thumb|The Blue Train]]  ===Railway=== [[Commuter rail]] services around Pretoria are operated by [[Metrorail Gauteng|Metrorail]]. The routes, originating from the city centre, extend south to [[Germiston]] and [[Johannesburg]], west to [[Atteridgeville]], northwest to [[Ga-Rankuwa]], north to [[Soshanguve]] and east to [[Mamelodi]].  The [[Gautrain]] high-speed railway line runs from the eastern suburb of [[Hatfield, Pretoria|Hatfield]] to [[Pretoria railway station|Pretoria Station]] and then southwards to [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]], [[Midrand]], [[Marlboro, Gauteng|Marlboro]], [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[OR Tambo International Airport]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]] and [[Parktown]].

It enters the city from the south as the Ben Schoeman Highway. At the Brakfontein Interchange with the [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]] it continues as The N1 Eastern Bypass bisects the large expanse of the eastern suburbs, routing traffic from [[Johannesburg]] to [[Polokwane]] and the north of the country. The [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]] is the original N1, and served the same function before the construction of the highway. It runs through the centre of town rather than the eastern suburbs.  The [[N4 road (South Africa)|N4]] enters the town as a highway from [[Witbank]] in the east, merging with the N1 at the Proefplaas Interchange. It begins again north of the city, branching west from the N1 as the Platinum Highway, forming the Northern Bypass, and heading to [[Rustenburg]]. The N4 runs east-west through South Africa, connecting [[Maputo]] to [[Gaborone]]. Before the Platinum Highway was built, the N4 continued passed the Proefplaas Interchange to the city centre, where it became a regular road, before again becoming a highway west of the city. These roads are now designated the M2 and M4. There is a third, original east-west road: the [[R104 road (South Africa)|R104]], Church Street. Church Street is in the process of being renamed to a number of new names.  The [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]] starts in the centre of town from the M4 (former N4). It is a normal road heading south through the centre before becoming the Ben Schoeman highway. At the Brakfontein interchange, the Ben Schoeman highway becomes the N1, but the N14 continues as the intersecting west-south-western highway towards [[Krugersdorp]]. The [[R114 road (South Africa)|R114]] parallels the N14 in its westward journey running just to the north of the highway.  The [[R21 road (South Africa)|R21]] provides a second north-south highway, further east. It starts from the Fountains Interchange south of the city centre, but is still a road until Monument Park, when it becomes a true highway. It crosses the N1 east of the Brakfontein Interchange at the Flying Saucer Interchange and runs north/south towards [[Ekurhuleni]] (specifically [[Kempton Park, Gauteng|Kempton Park]] and [[Boksburg]]). Importantly it links Pretoria with the [[OR Tambo International Airport]] in Kempton Park.  A proposed third north-south highway, in the west of the city, the [[R80 road (South Africa)|R80]] is partially built. At present the highway begins in [[Soshanguve]]. It terminates just north of the city centre at an intersection with the M1. Plans have been in place for some time to extend this all the way past the M4 and N14 highways to the N1 in Randburg.  Pretoria is also served by many regional roads. The [[R55 road (South Africa)|R55]] starts at an interchange with the R80, and runs north-south west of the city to [[Sandton]]. The [[R50 road (South Africa)|R50]] starts from the N1 just after the Flying Saucer Interchange in the south-east of the city, and continues south-east towards [[Delmas, Mpumalanga|Delmas]]. The [[R511 road (South Africa)|R511]] runs north-south from [[Randburg]] towards [[Brits, North-West|Brits]] and barely by-passes Pretoria to the west. The [[R514 road (South Africa)|R514]] starts from the M1, north of the city centre, and terminates at the R511. The [[R513 road (South Africa)|R513]] crosses Pretoria's northern suburbs from east to west. It links Pretoria to [[Cullinan, Gauteng|Cullinan]] and [[Bronkhorstspruit]] in the east and [[Hartbeespoort]] in the west. The [[R566 road (South Africa)|R566]] takes origin in Pretoria's northern suburbs, and exits the town to the west just north of the R513. It connects Pretoria to [[Brits, North West|Brits]]. Finally the [[R573 road (South Africa)|R573]] starts from the R513, just east of the town and heads north-east to [[Siyabuswa]].  Pretoria is also served internally by [[Metropolitan Routes in Pretoria|metropolitan routes]].  ===Airports=== For scheduled air services, Pretoria is served by Johannesburg's airports: [[OR Tambo International Airport|OR Tambo International]], {{convert|45|km}} south of central Pretoria; and [[Lanseria Airport|Lanseria]], {{convert|35|km}} south-west of the city. [[Wonderboom Airport]] in the suburb of Wonderboom in the north of Pretoria services light commercial and private aircraft. There are two military air bases to the south of the city, [[AFB Swartkop|Swartkop]] and [[AFB Waterkloof|Waterkloof]].  ==Society and Culture==  ===Media=== {{Main|Media in Pretoria}} Since Pretoria forms part the [[Tshwane]] Metropolitan Municipality, most radio, television and paper media is the same as what can be found in the rest of the metro area.  ===Museums=== [[File:Voortrekker Monument.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Voortrekker Monument]]]] [[File:Transvaal Museum Night.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Transvaal Museum]]]]  * [[African Window]] * [[Freedom Park (South Africa)|Freedom Park]] * [[Kruger House (Pretoria)|Kruger House]] (Residence of the president of the ZAR, [[Paul Kruger]]) * [[Mapungubwe Museum]] * [[Melrose House]] (The [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] which ended the [[Anglo-Boer War]] was signed here in 1902) * [[Pretoria Art Museum]] * [[Pretoria Forts]] * [[Transvaal Museum]] * [[Van Tilburg Collection]] * [[Sammy Marks House]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ditsong.org.za/sammymarks.htm |title=: Ditsong Museums Of South Africa : |publisher=Ditsong.org.za |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> * [[Van Wouw Museum]] * [[Voortrekker Monument]]  <gallery> File:Anfiteatro - Freedom Park.jpg|Freedom Park's amphitheatre File:Old merensky.jpg| The [[Eduardo Villa]] collection is housed in the Old [[University of Pretoria Library Services|Merensky Library]], a national monument<ref name=evc>{{cite web |title=Edoardo Villa Collection |url=http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=10323 |publisher=University of Pretoria |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> File:Culthistory.jpg|African Window File:4 Paul Kruger's House.jpg|Paul Kruger's House File:Melrose house SA.jpg|Melrose House </gallery>  ===Music=== A number of popular South African bands and musicians are originally from Pretoria. These include Desmond and the Tutus, Bittereinder, The Black Cat Bones, [[Seether]], popular mostwako rapper [[JR]], and [[DJ Mujava]] who was raised in the town of Attridgeville.  The song \"Marching to Pretoria\" refers to this city.  Pretoria was the capital of the [[South African Republic]] (aka Republic of the Transvaal; 1852-1881 and 1884-1902) the principal battleground for the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]], the latter which brought both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State republic under British rule.  \"Marching to Pretoria\" was one of the songs that British soldiers sang as they marched from the [[Cape Colony]], under British Rule since 1814, to the capital of the Southern African Republic (or in Dutch, ''Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek''). As the song's refrain puts it: \"We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria / We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hurrah.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/folk-songs-with-chords/Marching%20To%20Pretoria.htm |title=Traditional & Folk Songs with Chords: Marching To Pretoria, |publisher=Traditionalmusic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref>  The opening line of [[John Lennon]]'s [[Beatles]]' song [[I Am the Walrus]], \"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together,\" is often believed to be based on the lyric \"I'm with you and you're with me and so we are all together\"<ref>traditionalmusic.co.uk, ''op. cit.''</ref> in \"Marching to Pretoria.\" Lennon denied this, insisting his lyrics came from \"nothing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/i-am-the-walrus/lyrics.html |title=\"'I Am the Walrus' Lyrics,\" Shmoop: We Speak Student |publisher=Shmoop.com |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref>  ===Public art and galleries===  Pretoria is home to an extensive portfolio of public art. A diverse and evolving city, Pretoria boasts a vibrant art scene and a variety of works that range from sculptures to murals to pieces by internationally and locally renowned artists. The [[Pretoria Art Museum]] is home to a vast collection of local artworks. After a bequestby of 17th century Dutch artworks by Lady Michaelis in 1932 the art collection of Pretoria City Council expanded quickly to include South African works by Henk [[Pierneef]], [[Pieter Wenning]], [[Frans Oerder]], [[Anton van Wouw]] and [[Irma Stern]].<ref name=\"gautengcc.co.za\">http://www.gautengcc.co.za/pretoria-art-museum.htm</ref> And according to the museum: \"As South African museums in Cape Town and Johannesburg already had good collections of 17th, 18th and 19th century European art, it was decided to focus on compiling a representative collection of South African art\" making it somewhat unique compared to its contemporaries.<ref name=\"gautengcc.co.za\"/>  A 9 metre tall statue of former president [[Nelson Mandela]] was unveiled in front of the [[Union Buildings]] on 16 December 2013.<ref>http://mandela.southafrica.net/map/view/the-nelson-mandela-statue-at-the-union-buildings</ref> Since Nelson Mandela's inauguration as South Africa's first majority elected president the Union Buildings have come to represent the new 'Rainbow Nation'.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-17/world27s-largest-statue-of-nelson-mandela-unveiled-in-pretoria/5160450</ref> Public art in Pretoria has flourished since the 2010 [[FIFA World Cup]] with many areas receiving new public artworks.<ref>http://www.tshwane.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx</ref>  ===Sport=== [[File:Loftus Versfeld Stadium.jpg|thumb|Loftus Versfeld Stadium]] One of the most popular sports in Pretoria is [[rugby union]]. [[Loftus Versfeld Stadium|Loftus Versfeld]] is home to the [[Blue Bulls]], who compete in the domestic [[Currie Cup]], and also to the [[Bulls (rugby)|Bulls]] in the international [[Super Rugby]] competition.

As there is no international cricket stadium in the city, it does not host any major cricket tournament, although the nearby situated [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]] has [[Supersport Park]] which is an international cricket stadium and has hosted many important tournaments such as [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]], [[2009 IPL]] and [[2009 ICC Champions Trophy]]. The most local team to Pretoria is the [[Titans cricket team|Titans]]. Many Pretoria born cricketers have gone on to play for [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], including current ODI captain [[AB de Villiers]] and T20 captain [[Faf du Plessis]].  The Pretoria Transnet Blind Cricket Club is situated in Pretoria and is currently the biggest Blind Cricket club in South Africa. Their field is at the Transnet Engineering campus on Lynette Street, home of differently disabled cricket.

The [[Tshwane University of Technology]] (commonly referred to as TUT) is a [[higher education]] institution, offering [[vocational]] oriented diplomas and degrees, and came into being through a merger of Technikon Northern Gauteng, Technikon North-West and Technikon Pretoria. TUT caters for approximately 60,000 students and it has become the largest residential higher education institution in South Africa.  The [[University of South Africa]] (commonly referred to as Unisa), founded in 1873 as the [[University of the Cape of Good Hope]], is the largest university on the African continent and attracts a third of all higher education students in South Africa. It spent most of its early history as an examining agency for Oxford and Cambridge universities and as an incubator from which most other universities in South Africa are descended. In 1946 it was given a new role as a distance education university and in 2012 it had a student headcount of over 300 000 students, including African and international students in 130 countries worldwide, making it one of the world's mega universities. Unisa is a dedicated open distance education institution and offers both vocational and academic programmes.  The [[University of Pretoria]] (commonly referred to as UP, Tuks, or Tukkies) is a multi campus [[public university|public]] research university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100523104119724 |title=SA Universities Retrieved 21 January 2011 |publisher=Universityworldnews.com |accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> The university was established in 1908 as the Pretoria campus of the [[Johannesburg]] based [[Transvaal University College]] and is the fourth South African institution in continuous operation to be awarded university status.

Although the name change was approved by the SAGNC, it has not yet been approved by the Minister of Arts and Culture. The matter is currently under consideration while he has requested further research on the matter. Should the Minister approve the name change, the name will be published in the Government Gazette, giving the public opportunity to comment on the matter. The Minister can then refer that public response back to the SAGNC, before presenting his recommendation before parliament, who will vote on the change. Various public interest groups have warned that the name change will be challenged in court, should the minister approve the renaming. The long process involved made it unlikely the name would change anytime soon, if ever, even assuming the Minister had approved the change in early 2006.  The Tshwane Metro Council has advertised ''Tshwane'' as \"Africa's leading capital city\" since the name change was approved by the SAGNC in 2005. This has led to further controversy, however, as the name of the city had not yet been changed officially, and the council was, at best, acting prematurely. Following a complaint lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), it was ruled that such advertisements are deliberately misleading and should be withdrawn from all media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,9294,2-7-12_2097251,00.html |title=SABC pulls 'Tshwane city' ads |publisher=News24.com |date=11 April 2007 |accessdate=3 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090625212602/http://www.news24.com:80/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,9294,2-7-12_2097251,00.html |archivedate=25 June 2009 }}</ref>  Despite the rulings of the ASA, Tshwane Metro Council failed to discontinue their \"City of Tshwane\" advertisements. As a result, the ASA requested that Tshwane Metro pay for advertisements in which it admits that it has misled the public. Refusing to abide by the ASA's request, the Metro Council was banned consequently from placing any advertisements in the South African media that refer to Tshwane as the capital. ASA may still place additional sanctions on the Metro Council that would prevent it from placing any advertisements in the South African media, including council notices and employment vacancies.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=594&art_id=vn20070423045707464C538603 |title=SA capital advert row sparks ad-alert threat, IOL |publisher=Iol.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/business/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&lvl2=buss&ArticleID=1518-1786_2103974 |title=Media can't place Tshwane ads, FIN24 |publisher=Fin24.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090623161600/http://www.fin24.co.za:80/articles/business/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&lvl2=buss&ArticleID=1518-1786_2103974 |archivedate=23 June 2009 }}</ref>  After the ruling, the Metro Council continued to place ''Tshwane'' advertisements, but placed them on council-owned advertising boards and busstops throughout the municipal area.

A psychiatrist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of [[mental disorder]]s. Psychiatrists are [[medical doctor]]s, unlike [[psychologist]]s, and must evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental, or a strictly psychiatric one. The translation from Greek and Latin origin is as follows: \"Psych\"-Greek transliterated meaning breath, life, soul, spirit or mind; \"Iatro\" is Greek for physician and -ist in Latin comes from \"ista or iste\" and the pronoun means \"that one\" or \"specialist\".  As part of the clinical assessment process they may employ a [[mental status examination]], a [[physical examination]], [[brain imaging]] such as [[computerized tomography]]  (CT/CAT scan), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanning, and [[blood testing]]. Psychiatrists prescribe medicine, and may also use [[psychotherapy]], although the vast majority do medical management and refer to a [[psychologist]] or another specialized therapist for weekly to bi-monthly psychotherapy.  == Subspecialties == The field of psychiatry has many subspecialties (also known as [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] that require additional training which are certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) and require Maintenance of Certification Program (MOC) to continue. The following include:<ref>{{Cite web|title = Taking a Subspecialty Exam - American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology|url = http://www.abpn.com/become-certified/taking-a-subspecialty-exam/|accessdate = 2015-09-19}}</ref>  * [[Clinical neurophysiology]] * [[Forensic psychiatry]] * [[Addiction psychiatry]] * [[Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] * [[Geriatric psychiatry]] * [[Hospice and palliative medicine]] * [[Pain management]] * [[Psychosomatic medicine]] (also known as [[Liaison psychiatry|consultation-liaison psychiatry]]) * [[Sleep medicine]] * [[Brain Injury Medicine]]  Further, other specialties that exist include:<ref name=\"UKReq\" /> * [[Cross-cultural psychiatry]] * [[Emergency psychiatry]] * [[Learning disability]] * [[Neurodevelopmental disorder]] * [[Cognition]] diseases as in various forms of [[dementia]] * [[Biological psychiatry]] * [[Community psychiatry]] * [[Global Mental Health]] * [[Military psychiatry]] * [[Social psychiatry]] * [[Sports Psychiatry]]  Some psychiatrists specialize in helping certain age groups.

This role can be performed by a team of experts that include mental health specialists (specialists with [[Ph.D]] in [[Neuroscience]] and/or [[Psychology]] ) who can assist the psychiatrist to relay proper recommendations to the primary care team in treatment planning. The psychiatric consultant may suggest treatment modifications for the primary team to consider, recommend or see the patient for an in-person consultation, and consult patients who are clinically challenging or who need specialty mental health services.  == Professional requirements == While requirements to become a psychiatrist differ from country to country, all require a medical degree.<ref name=UKReq>The Royal College of Psychiatrists.

This extended period involves comprehensive training in psychiatric diagnosis, psychopharmacology, medical care issues, and psychotherapies.  All accredited psychiatry residencies in the United States require proficiency in [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]], brief, psychodynamic, and supportive psychotherapies.  Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine or pediatrics, plus a minimum of two months of neurology during their first year of residency, referred to as an \"internship\".<ref name=USReq /> After completing their training, psychiatrists are eligible to take a specialty board examination to become board-certified.<ref name=USReq />  The total amount of time required to complete educational and training requirements in the field of psychiatry in the United States is 12 years after high school. Subspecialists in child and adolescent psychiatry are required to complete a two-year fellowship program, the first year of which can run concurrently with the fourth year of the general psychiatry residency program. This adds one to two years of training.  ===United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland=== In the [[United Kingdom]], psychiatrists must hold a medical degree.<ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerinfoforschoolleavers.aspx Careers info for School leavers]</ref>  These degrees are often abbreviated [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB BChir, MB BCh, MB ChB, BM BS, or MB BS]].  Following this, the individual will work as a [[Foundation House Officer]] for two additional years in the UK, or one year as [[Intern]] in the Republic of Ireland to achieve registration as a basic medical practitioner. Training in psychiatry can then begin and it is taken in two parts: three years of Basic Specialist Training culminating in the MRCPsych exam followed by three years of Higher Specialist Training, referred to as \"ST4-6\" in the UK and \"Senior Registrar Training\" in the Republic of Ireland. Candidates with MRCPsych degree and complete basic training must reinterview for higher specialist training. At this stage, the development of speciality interests such as forensic, child/adolescent take place. At the end of 3 years of higher specialist training, candidates are awarded a CCT (UK) or CCST (Ireland), both meaning Certificate of Completion of (Specialist) Training. At this stage, the psychiatrist can register as a specialist and the qualification of CC(S)T is recognized in all EU/EEA states. As such, training in the UK and Ireland is considerably longer than in the US or Canada and frequently takes around 8–9 years following graduation from medical school. Those with a CC(S)T will be able to apply for Consultant posts. Those with training from outside the EU/EEA should consult local/native medical boards to review their qualifications and eligibility for equivalence recognition (for example, those with a US residency and ABPN qualification).  ===Netherlands=== In the [[Netherlands]] one must complete [[Medical school#Netherlands and Belgium|medical school]] after which one is certified as a medical doctor. After a strict selection program one can specialize in psychiatry: a 4.5 year specialization. During this specialization, the resident has to do a 6-month residency in the field of social psychiatry, a 12-month residency in a field of their own choice (which can be child psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, somatic medicine or medical research).  To become an adolescent psychiatrist, one has to do an extra specialization period of 2 more years. In short this means that it takes at least 10.5 years of study to become a psychiatrist which can go up to 12.5 years if one becomes a children's and adolescent psychiatrist.  == See also == {{columns |width = 22em |col1 = *[[List of famous figures in psychiatry]] *[[List of psychiatrists]] *[[Medicine]] |col2 = *[[Mental health]] *[[Mental health professional]] *[[Mental illness]] |col3 = *[[Psychiatry]] *[[Psychiatric nursing]] *[[Clinical psychology]] *[[Psychologist]] *[[Psychology]] }}  ==References== {{reflist}}  == Further reading == * American Psychiatric Association.

These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether [[number theory]] is [[consistency proof|consistent]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]].  The need to formalize [[arithmetic]] was not well appreciated until the work of [[Hermann Grassmann]], who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the [[successor function|successor operation]] and [[mathematical induction|induction]].<ref>Grassmann 1861</ref> In 1881, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] provided an [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatization|axiomatization]] of natural-number arithmetic.<ref>Peirce 1881; also see Shields 1997</ref> In&nbsp;1888, [[Richard Dedekind]] proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in&nbsp;1889 Peano published a more precisely formulated version of them as a collection of axioms in his book, ''The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method'' ({{lang-la|Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita}}).  The Peano axioms contain three types of statements. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set \"number\". The next four are general statements about [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]; in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the Peano axioms, but rather as axioms of the \"underlying logic\".<ref>van Heijenoort 1967:94</ref> The next three axioms are [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final axiom is a [[second-order logic|second order]] statement of the principle of [[mathematical induction]] over the natural numbers. A weaker first-order system called '''Peano arithmetic''' is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the [[Second-order arithmetic#Induction and comprehension schema|second-order induction]] axiom with a first-order [[axiom schema]].  == Formulation ==  When Peano formulated his axioms, the language of [[mathematical logic]] was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and [[logical implication|implication]] (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the [[Begriffsschrift]] by [[Gottlob Frege]], published in 1879.<ref>Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 2</ref> Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of [[George Boole|Boole]] and [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]].<ref>Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 83</ref>  The Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of ''[[natural numbers]]'', usually represented as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''N'' or <math>\\mathbb{N}.</math> The [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] (a formal language's [[non-logical symbol]]s) for the axioms includes a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol ''S''.  The constant 0 is assumed to be a natural number: {{ordered list|start=1 |1= 0 is a natural number. }} The next four axioms describe the [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]. Since they are logically valid in first-order logic with equality, they are not considered to be part of \"the Peano axioms\" in modern treatments.<ref>Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 83</ref> {{ordered list|start=2 |2= For every natural number ''x'', ''x'' = ''x''. That is, equality is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. |3= For all natural numbers ''x'' and ''y'', if ''x'' = ''y'', then ''y'' = ''x''. That is, equality is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]. |4= For all natural numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'', if ''x'' = ''y'' and ''y'' = ''z'', then ''x'' = ''z''. That is, equality is [[transitive relation|transitive]]. |5= For all ''a'' and ''b'', if ''b'' is a natural number and ''a'' = ''b'', then ''a'' is also a natural number. That is, the natural numbers are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under equality. }} The remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued \"[[successor function|successor]]\" [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''S''. {{ordered list|start=6 |6=For every natural number ''n'', ''S''(''n'') is a natural number. }} Peano's original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the \"first\" natural number.<ref>Peano 1889, p. 1</ref> This choice is arbitrary, as axiom 1 does not endow the constant 0 with any additional properties. However, because{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  0 is the [[identity element|additive identity]] in arithmetic, most modern formulations of the Peano axioms start from 0. Axioms 1 and 6 define a [[unary numeral system|unary]] representation of the natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as ''S''(0), 2 as ''S''(''S''(0)) (which is also ''S''(1)), and, in general, any natural number ''n'' as the result of ''n''-fold application of ''S'' to 0, denoted as ''S''<sup>''n''</sup>(0). The next two axioms define the properties of this representation. {{ordered list|start=7 |7=For all natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', ''m'' = ''n'' if and only if ''S''(''m'') = ''S''(''n''). That is, ''S'' is an [[injective function|injection]]. |8=For every natural number ''n'', ''S''(''n'') = 0 is false. That is, there is no natural number whose successor is 0. }}  [[File:Domino effect visualizing exclusion of junk term by induction axiom.jpg|thumb|The set of natural numbers can be illustrated by the infinite chain of light brown domino pieces, with the nearest piece corresponding to 0. However, the Peano axioms 1–8 are also satisfied by the set of all pieces present, both light and dark <ref>Note: The non-contiguous set satisfies axiom 1 as it has a 0 element, 2-5 as it doesn't affect equality relations, 6 & 8 as all pieces have a successor, bar the zero element and axiom 7 as no two dominos topple, or are toppled by, the same piece.</ref>{{OR?|date=September 2015}}. The induction axiom, 9, corresponds to the requirement that if the first light brown domino piece is overthrown, then all pieces of the set will eventually fall (\"[[domino effect]]\"); it is only satisfied if the entire set of considered pieces forms a chain.<ref>Note: Though the ring of dark pieces would itself satisfy axiom 9, it wouldn't satisfy axiom 8, as its zero element would have a predecessor.</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}]]  Axioms 1, 6, 7 and 8 imply that the set of natural numbers contains the distinct elements 0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), and furthermore that {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …} ⊆ ''N''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This shows that the set of natural numbers is infinite. However, to show that ''N'' = {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …}, it must be shown that ''N'' ⊆ {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …}; i.e., it must be shown that every natural number is included in {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …}. To do this however requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the ''axiom of induction''. This axiom provides a method for reasoning about the set of all natural numbers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  {{ordered list|start=9 |9=If ''K'' is a set such that: * ''0'' is in ''K'', and * for every natural number ''n'', if ''n'' is in ''K'', then ''S''(''n'') is in ''K'', then ''K'' contains every natural number. }}  The induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form: {{ordered list|start=9 |9=If φ is a unary [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] such that: * φ(0) is true, and * for every natural number ''n'', if φ(''n'') is true, then φ(''S''(''n'')) is true, then φ(''n'') is true for every natural number ''n''. }}  In Peano's original formulation, the induction axiom is a [[second-order logic|second-order axiom]]. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker [[first-order logic|first-order]] induction scheme.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section [[#Models|Models]] below.  == Arithmetic == The Peano axioms can be augmented with the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] and the usual [[total order|total (linear) ordering]] on [[natural numbers#Notation|''N'']]. The respective functions and relations are constructed in [[second-order logic]], and are shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.  === Addition === [[Addition in N|Addition]] is a function that [[map (mathematics)|maps]] two natural numbers (two elements of ''N'') to another one. It is defined [[recursion|recursively]] as: :<math>\\begin{align} a + 0       &= a ,\\\\ a + S (b) &= S (a + b). \\end{align}</math> For example, :''a'' + 1 = ''a'' + ''S''(0) = ''S''(''a'' + 0) = ''S''(''a''). The [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (''N'', +) is a [[commutative]] [[semigroup]] with identity element 0. (''N'', +) is also a [[cancellation property|cancellative]] [[magma (algebra)|magma]], and thus [[embedding|embeddable]] in a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The smallest group embedding ''N'' is the [[integer]]s.  === Multiplication === Similarly, [[multiplication]] is a function mapping two natural numbers to another one. Given addition, it is defined recursively as: :<math>\\begin{align} a \\cdot 0 &= 0, \\\\ a \\cdot S (b) &= a + (a \\cdot b). \\end{align}</math> It is easy to see that setting b equal to    0<!---don't change to 1: S(b) is the multiplicative identity below, not just b--->    yields the multiplicative [[identity element|identity]]: :''a'' · 1 = ''a'' · ''S''(0) = ''a'' + (''a'' · 0) = ''a'' + 0 = ''a'' Moreover, multiplication [[distributive law|distributes over]] addition: :''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c''). Thus, (''N'', +, 0, ·, 1) is a commutative [[semiring]].  === Inequalities === The usual [[total order]] relation ≤ on natural numbers can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number: :For all ''a'', ''b'' ∈ ''N'', ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if there exists some ''c'' ∈ ''N'' such that ''a'' + ''c'' = ''b''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for <math> a, b, c \\in N </math>, if ''a'' ≤ ''b'', then: * ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c'', and * ''a'' · ''c'' ≤ ''b'' · ''c''. Thus, the structure (''N'', +, ·, 1, 0, ≤) is an [[ordered ring|ordered semiring]]; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring.  The axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following ''strong'' form, making use of the ≤ order:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} :For any [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] φ, if :* φ(0) is true, and :* for every ''n'', ''k'' ∈ ''N'', if ''k'' ≤ ''n'' implies ''φ''(''k'') is true, then φ(''S''(''n'')) is true, :then for every ''n'' ∈ ''N'', φ(''n'') is true. This form of the induction axiom is a simple consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} for reasoning about the ≤ order. For example, to show that the naturals are [[well-order]]ed—every [[empty set|nonempty]] [[subset]] of ''N'' has a [[least element]]—one can reason as follows.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Let a nonempty ''X'' ⊆ ''N'' be given and assume ''X'' has no least element. * Because 0 is the least element of ''N'', it must be that 0 ∉ ''X''. * For any ''n'' ∈ ''N'', suppose for every ''k'' ≤ ''n'', ''k'' ∉ ''X''. Then ''S''(''n'') ∉ ''X'', for otherwise it would be the least element of ''X''. Thus, by the strong induction principle, for every ''n'' ∈ ''N'', ''n'' ∉ ''X''. Thus, ''X'' ∩ ''N'' = ∅, which [[contradiction|contradicts]] ''X'' being a nonempty subset of ''N''. Thus ''X'' has a least element.  == First-order theory of arithmetic == All of the Peano axioms except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in [[first-order logic]].<ref>Partee ''et al.'' 2012:215</ref> The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is [[second-order logic|second-order]], since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), but it can be transformed into a first-order ''[[axiom schema]]'' of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.<ref>Harsanyi 1983.</ref>  First-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have an important limitation, however. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the [[successor function|successor operation]], but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.  The following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality), which contains six of the seven axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]], is sufficient for this purpose:<ref>Mendelson 1997:155</ref> * ∀''x''∈''N''. 0 ≠ ''S''(''x'') * ∀''x'',''y''∈''N''. ''S''(''x'') = ''S''(''y'') ⇒ ''x'' = ''y'' * ∀''x''∈''N''. ''x'' + 0 = ''x'' * ∀''x'',''y''∈''N''. ''x'' + ''S''(''y'') = ''S''(''x'' + ''y'') * ∀''x''∈''N''. ''x'' ⋅ 0 = 0 * ∀''x'',''y''∈''N''. ''x'' ⋅ ''S''(''y'') = ''x'' ⋅ ''y'' + ''x''  In addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a [[Countable set|countably infinite]] set of [[axioms]]. For each formula φ(''x'',''y''<sub>1</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>) in the language of Peano arithmetic, the '''first-order induction axiom''' for φ is the sentence :<math>\\forall \\bar{y} (\\varphi(0,\\bar{y}) \\land \\forall x ( \\varphi(x,\\bar{y})\\Rightarrow\\varphi(S(x),\\bar{y})) \\Rightarrow \\forall x \\varphi(x,\\bar{y}))</math> where <math>\\bar{y}</math> is an abbreviation for ''y''<sub>1</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>. The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom, that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula φ.  === Equivalent axiomatizations === There are many different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, such as the one just described, use a signature that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of [[ordered ring|ordered semirings]], including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.<ref>Kaye 1991, pp. 16–18</ref>  <!-- These axioms are taken directly from Kaye 1991. Please don't \"tweak\" them, add additional axioms, or remove axioms without discussion on the talk page. --> # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)</math>, i.e., addition is [[associative law|associative]]. # <math>\\forall x, y \\in N</math>. <math>x + y = y + x</math>, i.e., addition is [[commutative law|commutative]]. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot (y \\cdot z)</math>, i.e., multiplication is associative. # <math>\\forall x, y \\in N</math>. <math>x \\cdot y = y \\cdot x</math>, i.e., multiplication is commutative. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>x \\cdot (y + z) = (x \\cdot y) + (x \\cdot z)</math>, i.e., the [[distributive law]]. # <math>\\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>x + 0 = x \\and x \\cdot 0 = 0</math>, i.e., zero is the identity element for addition. # <math>\\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>x \\cdot 1 = x</math>, i.e., one is the identity element for multiplication. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>x < y \\and y < z \\Rightarrow x < z</math>, i.e., the '&lt;' operator is [[Transitive relation|transitive]]. # <math>\\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>\\neg (x < x)</math>, i.e., the '&lt;' operator is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]]. # <math>\\forall x, y \\in N</math>. <math>x < y \\or x = y \\or y < x</math>. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>x < y \\Rightarrow x + z < y + z</math>. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>0 < z \\and x < y \\Rightarrow x \\cdot z < y \\cdot z</math>. # <math>\\forall x, y \\in N x < y \\Rightarrow \\exists z \\in N x + z = y</math>. # <math>0 < 1 \\and \\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>x > 0 \\Rightarrow x \\geq 1</math>. # <math>\\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>x \\geq 0</math>. The theory defined by these axioms is known as '''PA<sup>−</sup>'''; PA is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema.  An important property of PA<sup>−</sup> is that any structure ''M'' satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by ≤) isomorphic to ''N''. Elements of ''M'' \\ ''N'' are known as '''nonstandard''' elements.  == Models == A [[model theory|model]] of the Peano axioms is a triple (''N'', 0, ''S''), where ''N'' is a (necessarily infinite) set, 0 ∈ ''N'' and ''S'' : ''N'' → ''N'' satisfies the axioms above. [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] proved in his 1888 book, ''What are numbers and what should they be'' ({{lang-de|Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen}}) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. In particular, given two models (''N''<sub>''A''</sub>, 0<sub>''A''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''A''</sub>) and (''N''<sub>''B''</sub>, 0<sub>''B''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''B''</sub>) of the Peano axioms, there is a unique [[homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''N''<sub>''A''</sub> → ''N''<sub>''B''</sub> satisfying :<math>\\begin{align} f(0_A) &= 0_B \\\\ f(S_A (n)) &= S_B (f (n)) \\end{align}</math> and it is a [[bijective function|bijection]]. This means that second-order Peano axioms are [[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]]. This is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, however.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  === Nonstandard models === Although the usual [[natural number]]s satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other '''[[non-standard model]]s''' as well; the [[compactness theorem]] implies{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.  When interpreted as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.  It is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. The answer is affirmative as [[Skolem]] in 1933 provided an explicit  construction of such a nonstandard model.  On the other hand, [[Tennenbaum's theorem]], proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is [[computable function|computable]].<ref>Kaye 1991, sec. 11.3</ref> This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. However, there is only one possible [[order type]] of a countable nonstandard model. Letting ω be the order type of the natural numbers, ζ be the order type of the integers, and η be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is ω + ζ·η, which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.  === Set-theoretic models === {{Main|Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers}} The Peano axioms can be derived from [[set theory|set theoretic]] constructions of the [[natural number]]s and axioms of set theory such as the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]].<ref>Suppes 1960; Hatcher 1982</ref> The standard construction of the naturals, due to [[John von Neumann]], starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, ∅, and an operator ''s'' on sets defined as: :''s''(''a'') = ''a'' ∪ { ''a'' }. The set of natural numbers '''N''' is defined as the intersection of all sets [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under ''s'' that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it: :<math>\\begin{align} 0 &= \\emptyset \\\\ 1 &= s(0) = s(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset \\cup \\{ \\emptyset \\} = \\{ \\emptyset \\} = \\{ 0 \\} \\\\ 2 &= s(1) = s(\\{ 0 \\}) = \\{ 0 \\} \\cup \\{ \\{ 0 \\} \\} = \\{ 0 , \\{ 0 \\} \\} = \\{ 0, 1 \\} \\\\ 3 &= ... = \\{ 0, 1, 2 \\} \\end{align}</math> and so on. The set '''N''' together with 0 and the [[successor function]] ''s'' : '''N''' → '''N''' satisfies the Peano axioms. <!-- dubious: The induction axiom is proven using the [[axiom of infinity]] of set theory.-->  Peano arithmetic is [[equiconsistent]] with several weak systems of set theory.<ref>Tarski &amp; Givant 1987, sec. 7.6</ref> One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of [[general set theory]] ([[extensionality]], existence of the [[empty set]], and the [[general set theory|axiom of adjunction]]), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.  === Interpretation in category theory === The Peano axioms can also be understood using [[category theory]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Let ''C'' be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with [[terminal object]] 1<sub>''C''</sub>, and define the category of '''pointed unary systems''', US<sub>1</sub>(''C'') as follows: * The objects of US<sub>1</sub>(''C'') are triples (''X'', 0<sub>''X''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>) where ''X'' is an object of ''C'', and 0<sub>''X''</sub> : 1<sub>''C''</sub> → ''X'' and ''S''<sub>''X''</sub> : ''X'' → ''X'' are ''C''-morphisms. * A morphism φ : (''X'', 0<sub>''X''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>) → (''Y'', 0<sub>''Y''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''Y''</sub>) is a ''C''-morphism φ : ''X'' → ''Y'' with φ 0<sub>''X''</sub> = 0<sub>''Y''</sub> and φ ''S''<sub>''X''</sub> = ''S''<sub>''Y''</sub> φ. Then ''C'' is said to satisfy the Dedekind–Peano axioms if US<sub>1</sub>(''C'') has an initial object; this initial object is known as a [[natural number object]] in ''C''. If (''N'', 0, ''S'') is this initial object, and (''X'', 0<sub>''X''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>) is any other object, then the unique map ''u'' : (''N'', 0, ''S'') → (''X'', 0<sub>''X''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>) is such that :<math>\\begin{align} u 0 &= 0_X, \\\\ u (S x) &= S_X (u x). \\end{align}</math> This is precisely the recursive definition of 0<sub>''X''</sub> and ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>.  == Consistency ==  {{Main|Hilbert's second problem}}  When the Peano axioms were first proposed, [[Bertrand Russell]] and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a \"natural number\". [[Henri Poincaré]] was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were ''consistent''; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything. In 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed the problem of proving their consistency using only [[Finitism|finitistic]] methods as the [[Hilbert's second problem|second]] of his [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three problems]].<ref>Hilbert 1900</ref> In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] proved his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]], which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.<ref>Godel 1931</ref>  Although it is widely claimed that Gödel's theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. Gödel himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958 Gödel published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using [[type theory]].<ref>Godel 1958</ref> In 1936, [[Gerhard Gentzen]] gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using [[transfinite induction]] up to an ordinal called [[epsilon zero|ε<sub>0</sub>]].<ref>Gentzen 1936</ref> Gentzen explained: \"The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles\". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε<sub>0</sub> can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a [[Turing machine]] describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.  The vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano's axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as [[Gentzen's consistency proof|Gentzen's proof]]. The small number of mathematicians who advocate [[ultrafinitism]] reject Peano's axioms because the axioms require an infinite set of natural numbers.  ==See also== * [[Foundations of mathematics]] * [[Gentzen's consistency proof]] * [[Goodstein's theorem]] * [[Paris–Harrington theorem]] * [[Presburger arithmetic]] * [[Robinson arithmetic]] * [[Second-order arithmetic]] * [[Non-standard model of arithmetic]] * [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]] * [[Frege's theorem]]  == Footnotes == {{reflist|2}}  == References == * [[Martin Davis]], 1974.

To the naked eye, it appears to be a single star, the [[list of brightest stars|eighth brightest]] in the night sky with a visual [[apparent magnitude]] of 0.34.<ref name=aaa413/> It is classified as a [[binary star]] system, consisting of a white [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star of [[spectral type]] F5&nbsp;IV–V, named '''Procyon&nbsp;A''', and a faint [[white dwarf]] companion of spectral type DQZ,<ref name=Provencal2002/> named '''Procyon&nbsp;B'''.  The reason for its brightness is not its intrinsic luminosity but its relative closeness to the [[Sun]].  As determined by the [[European Space Agency]] [[Hipparcos]] astrometry satellite,<ref name=aaa323_L49/><ref name=GSM/> it lies at a distance of just {{Convert|11.46|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}},<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> and is therefore one of our [[List of nearest stars|nearest stellar neighbours]]. Its closest neighboring star is [[Luyten's Star]], about {{Convert|1.12|ly|pc|abbr=on|lk=off}} away, and the latter would appear as a visual magnitude 2.7 star in the night sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Procyon.<ref name=Annot/>  ==Visibility== Procyon is the eighth brightest star in the night sky, [[Culmination|culminating]] at midnight on January 14.<ref name=\"Schaaf2008\"/> It forms one of the three [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the [[Winter Triangle]] [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], in combination with [[Sirius]] and [[Betelgeuse]].{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=166}} The prime period for evening viewing of Procyon is in late winter.<ref name=\"Schaaf2008\"/>  It has a [[color index]] is 0.42, and its hue has been described as having a faint yellow tinge to it.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=166}}  ==System== Procyon is a [[binary star]] system with a bright primary component, Procyon A, having an apparent magnitude of 0.34,<ref name=aaa413/> and a faint companion, Procyon B, at magnitude 10.7.<ref name=\"ApJ119_2\"/> The pair orbit each other with a [[orbital period|period]] of 40.82&nbsp;years along an elliptical orbit with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.407. The [[orbital plane|plane]] of their orbit is inclined at an angle of 31.1° to the line of sight with the Earth.<ref name=aj119_5/> The average separation of the two components is 15.0 [[astronomical unit|AU]]s, a little less than the distance between [[Uranus]] and the Sun, though the eccentric orbit carries them as close as 8.9&nbsp;AUs and as far as 21.0&nbsp;AU.<ref name=Kaler2011/>  ===Primary star=== The primary has a [[stellar classification]] of F5IV–V, indicating that it is a late-stage [[F-type main-sequence star]]. Procyon A is bright for its spectral class, suggesting that it is evolving into a ''[[subgiant]]'' that has nearly [[nuclear fusion|fused]] its core [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]], after which it will expand as \"burning\" moves outside the core.<ref name=aaa413/> As it continues to expand, the star will eventually swell to about 80 to 150 times its current diameter and become a red or orange color. This will probably happen within 10 to 100 million years.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=168}}  The [[effective temperature]] of the [[stellar atmosphere]] is an estimated 6,530&nbsp;K,<ref name=aaa413/> giving Procyon A a white hue. It is 1.5 times the [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}), twice the [[solar radius]] ({{Solar radius|link=y}}), and has 6.9 times the [[solar luminosity|Sun's luminosity]] ({{Solar luminosity|link=y}}).<ref name=aaa413/><ref name=aj131/> Both the core and the envelope of this star are [[Convection zone|convective]]; the two regions being separated by a wide [[radiation zone]].<ref name=Liebert2013/>  ====Oscillations==== In late June 2004, [[Canada]]'s orbital [[MOST satellite telescope]] carried out a 32-day survey of Procyon&nbsp;A. The continuous optical monitoring was intended to confirm [[solar-like oscillations]] in its brightness observed from Earth and to permit [[asteroseismology]]. No [[oscillations]] were detected and the authors concluded that the theory of stellar oscillations may need to be reconsidered.<ref name=nature430_921/> However, others argued that the non-detection was consistent with published ground-based [[radial velocity]] observations of [[solar-like oscillations]].<ref name=nature432_7015/><ref name=aaa432/>  [[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometric]] measurements from the [[NASA]] [[Wide Field Infrared Explorer]] (WIRE) satellite from 1999 and 2000 showed evidence of granulation ([[convection]] near the surface of the [[star]]) and [[solar-like oscillations]].<ref name=apj633/> Unlike the MOST result, the variation seen in the WIRE photometry was in agreement with [[radial velocity]] measurements from the ground. <gallery> File:Procyonorbitillustration.jpg|Procyon orbit </gallery>  ===White dwarf companion=== Like Sirius B, Procyon's companion is a [[white dwarf]] that was inferred from [[astrometry|astrometric]] data long before it was observed. Its existence had been postulated by [[Friedrich Bessel]] as early as 1844, and, although its orbital elements had been calculated by [[Arthur Auwers]] in 1862 as part of his thesis,<ref name=auwers/> Procyon&nbsp;B was not visually confirmed until 1896 when [[John Martin Schaeberle]] observed it at the predicted position using the 36-inch refractor at [[Lick Observatory]].<ref name=burnham78/> It is more difficult to observe from Earth than Sirius&nbsp;B, due to a greater [[apparent magnitude]] difference and smaller angular separation from its primary.<ref name=Kaler2011/>  At {{Solar mass|0.6|link=y}}, Procyon&nbsp;B is considerably less massive than Sirius&nbsp;B; however, the peculiarities of [[degenerate matter]] ensure that it is larger than its more famous neighbor, with an estimated radius of 8,600 [[kilometer|km]], versus 5,800&nbsp;km for Sirius&nbsp;B.<ref name=\"Provencal2002\" /><ref name=apj497/> The radius agrees with white dwarf models that assume a carbon core.<ref name=\"Provencal2002\" /> It has a [[stellar classification]] of DQZ,<ref name=Provencal2002/> having a helium-dominated atmosphere with traces of heavy elements. For reasons that remain unclear, the mass of Procyon&nbsp;B is unusually low for a white dwarf star of its type.<ref name=Liebert2013/> With a surface temperature of 7,740&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], it is also much cooler than Sirius&nbsp;B; this is a testament to its lesser mass and greater age. The mass of the progenitor star for Procyon B was about {{val|2.59|+0.22|-0.18|u=solar mass}} and it came to the end of its life some {{val|1.19|0.11}}&nbsp;Gyr ago, after a main-sequence lifetime of {{val|680|170}}&nbsp;Myr.<ref name=Liebert2013/>  ===X-ray emission=== Attempts to detect X-ray emission from Procyon with nonimaging, [[soft X-ray]]–sensitive detectors prior to 1975 failed.<ref name=apj202/><ref name=apj202/> Extensive observations of Procyon were carried out with the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory#OAO-3 (Copernicus)|Copernicus]] and [[TD-1A]] satellites in the late 1970s.<ref name=apj228_1/> The X-ray source associated with Procyon A/B was observed on April&nbsp;1, 1979, with the [[Einstein Observatory]] high-resolution imager (HRI).<ref name=apj540/> The HRI X-ray pointlike source location is ~4\" south of Procyon A, on the edge of the 90% confidence error circle, indicating identification with Procyon A rather than Procyon B which was located about 5\" north of Procyon&nbsp;A (about 9\" from the X-ray source location).<ref name=apj228_1/>  ===Possibility of life=== Life is unlikely around Procyon, because the habitable zone around 2.7&nbsp;AU from the primary may not contain stable orbits, due to the white dwarf companion with a [[periastron]] of 8.9 AU.{{or|date=July 2015}} Also the white dwarf companion to Procyon would have stressed life severely during its [[red-giant]] phase. Procyon emits more of its light in the [[ultraviolet]] spectrum, which may be damaging to life. Still, life cannot be ruled out for other stars of the spectral type of Procyon, but such life would have a relatively short time to evolve and would face heavy bombardment from [[comet]]s and [[meteorite]]s as happened in the first few million years of the [[Earth]]’s existence. Shortly after the phase of heavy bombardment has ended for a planet orbiting a star like Procyon the star is likely to leave the [[main sequence]] preventing further development of life.<ref name=exoplaneten/>  ==Etymology and cultural significance== Its name comes from the ancient Greek {{lang|grc|Προκύων}} (''{{transl|grc|Prokyon}}''), meaning \"before the dog\", since it precedes the \"Dog Star\" [[Sirius]] as it travels across the sky due to [[Earth]]'s rotation. (Although Procyon has a greater [[right ascension]], it also has a more northerly [[declination]], which means it will rise above the [[horizon]] earlier than Sirius from most northerly latitudes.) In Greek mythology, Procyon is associated with [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], a hound belonging to [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]], daughter of [[Icarius of Athens]].<ref name=mw1999/>  These two dog stars are referred to in the most ancient literature and were venerated by the [[Babylon]]ians and the [[Egypt]]ians, In Babylonian mythology, Procyon was known as Nangar the Carpenter, an aspect of [[Marduk]], involved in constructing and organising the celestial sky.<ref name=\"kelley11\">{{cite book|author=Kelley, David H.|author2=Milone, Eugene F.|author3=Aveni, A.F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|publisher=Springer|location=New York, New York|date=2011|pages=217|isbn=144197623X|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC&pg=PA217&dq=Procyon+Nangar&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1ebkT-2BN8fsmAW34riUCw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Procyon%20Nangar&f=false}}</ref>  The constellations in [[Slavic Macedonians|Macedonian]] folklore represented agricultural items and animals, reflecting their village way of life.

He was killed by the other hunters who convinced him to go on the sea ice. Procyon received this designation because it typically appears red (though sometimes slightly greenish) as it rises during the Arctic winter; this red color was associated with Sikuliarsiujuittuq's bloody end.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Arctic sky: Inuit astronomy, star lore, and legend |last = MacDonald |first = John |publisher = Royal Ontario Museum/Nunavut Research Institute|location=Toronto, Ontario/Iqaluit, NWT |date = 1998 |isbn = 9780888544278|pages=72, 231–33}}</ref>  ==Distance== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Procyon distance estimates |- !

The writings of [[Mary Rowlandson]] captured in the brutal fighting of [[King Philip's War]] are an example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the [[captivity narrative]], and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[Last of the Mohicans]]''. Some Native Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as laborers and bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast from 1802–1805.  ===French Revolutionary wars and Napoleonic wars=== The earliest known purposely built [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was established at [[Norman Cross]], England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of [[privateers]]. About 100 senior officers and some civilians \"of good social standing\", mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given ''parole d'honneur'' outside the prison, mainly in [[Peterborough]] although some as far away as [[Northampton]], [[Plymouth]], [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] and [[Abergavenny]]. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society.  ===Prisoner exchanges=== The extensive period of conflict during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1793–1815), followed by the [[United Kingdom – United States relations|Anglo-American]] [[War of 1812]], led to the emergence of a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] system for the [[exchange of prisoners]], even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.  ===American Civil War=== {{main|American Civil War prison camps}} At the start of the civil war a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held in camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed to perform any military duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger Pickenpaugh|title=Captives in Blue: The Civil War Prisons of the Confederacy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pWOfsOceCNUC&pg=PA57|year=2013|publisher=University of Alabama Press|pages=57–73}}</ref> The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. In the late summer of 1864, a year after the Dix-Hill Cartel was suspended; Confederate officials approached Union General Benjamin Butler, Union Commissioner of Exchange, about resuming the cartel and including the black prisoners. Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to Butler on August 18, 1864 with his now famous statement. He rejected the offer, stating in essence, that the Union could afford to leave their men in captivity, the Confederacy could not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ande/historyculture/grant-and-the-prisoner-exchange.htm |title=Myth: General Ulysses S.

National Geographic News. 1 July 2003.</ref>  ===Amelioration=== During the 19th century, there were increased efforts to improve the treatment and processing of prisoners. As a result of these emerging conventions, a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new [[treaty|conventions]] being adopted and becoming recognized as [[international law]] that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.  ===Hague and Geneva Conventions=== Specifically, Chapter II of the Annex to the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land'' covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further expanded in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War]] and were largely revised in the [[Third Geneva Convention]] in 1949.  Article 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] protects captured [[military personnel]], some [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters, and certain [[civilians]]. It applies from the moment a prisoner is captured until he or she is released or repatriated. One of the main provisions of the convention makes it illegal to [[torture]] prisoners and states that a prisoner can only be required to give their [[name]], [[date of birth]], [[Military rank|rank]] and [[service number]] (if applicable).  The [[ICRC]] has a special role to play, with regards to [[international humanitarian law]], in [[Restoring Family Links|restoring and maintaining family contact in times of war]], in particular concerning the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art.71 and GC IV, art.107).  However, nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, [[Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labor. The Germans also routinely executed Western Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the [[Commando Order]]. North Korean and North and South Vietnamese forces<ref name=\"south-viet\">{{cite web|title=In South Vietnamese Jails|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10775|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those conflicts.  ====Qualifications==== [[File:Japanese Beheading 1894.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese illustration depicting the beheading of Chinese captives. [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–5.]] To be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be lawful combatants entitled to combatant's privilege—which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing enemy combatants. To qualify under the Third Geneva Convention, a combatant must be part of a [[chain of command]], wear a \"fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance\", bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the [[laws and customs of war]]. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as \"[i]nhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".)  Thus, uniforms and/or badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status; and ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', [[terrorists]], [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], and [[Espionage|spies]] do not qualify because they do not always follow the laws and customs of war and therefore they fall under the category of [[unlawful combatants]]. In practice, these criteria are rarely interpreted strictly. [[Guerrilla]]s, for example, usually do not wear a uniform or carry arms openly, but captured guerrillas are often granted POW status.  The criteria are applied primarily to ''international'' armed conflicts; in [[civil wars]], [[insurgents]] are often treated as [[traitors]] or [[criminals]] by government forces, and are sometimes executed. However, in the [[American Civil War]], both sides treated captured troops as POWs, presumably out of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], although the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regarded [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.  ===Rights=== Under the Third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war (POW) must be:  *Treated humanely with respect for their persons and their honor *Able to inform their next of kin and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] of their capture *Allowed to communicate regularly with relatives and receive packages *Given adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical attention *Paid for work done and not forced to do work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or degrading *Released quickly after conflicts end *Not compelled to give any information except for name, age, rank, and service number<ref>{{cite web|title=Geneva Convention|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_geneva_con.html|publisher=Peace Pledge Union|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>  In addition, if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Story of an idea- the Film|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwB-Y6FUjY|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>  When a country is responsible for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished accordingly. An example of this is the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Trials]]. German and Japanese military commanders were prosecuted for preparing and initiating a [[war of aggression]], [[murder]], ill treatment, and [[deportation]] of individuals, and [[genocide]] during World War II.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penrose|first=Mary Margaret|title=War Crime|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635621/war-crime/224687/The-Nurnberg-and-Tokyo-trials|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> Most were executed or sentenced to life in prison for their crimes.  ===The United States Military Terminology and Code of Conduct=== [[File:VietnamCombatArtCATJamesPollockWaitingInterrogation.jpg|thumb|right|''Waiting interrogation, 199th LT INF BG'' by [[James Pollock (artist)|James Pollock]], [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Vietnam Combat Artists Program]] Team IV, (CAT IV 1967). [[Watercolor]] by Pollock depicts enemy suspects waiting interrogation during the [[Vietnam War]]. Courtesy [[National Museum of the United States Army|National Museum of the U. S. Army]].]]  [[The United States Military Code of Conduct]] was promulgated in 1955 via [[s:Executive Order 10631|Executive Order 10631]] under [[U.S. President|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to serve as a moral code for United States service members who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organization, specifically when U.S. forces were POWs during the [[Korean War]].  When a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, \"name, rank, serial number\"), receiving special favors or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.  Since the [[Vietnam War]], the official U.S. military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name change was introduced in order to distinguish between enemy and U.S. captives.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-40/ch1.htm#par2 |title=FM3-19.40 Part 1 Fundamentals of Internment/Resettlement Operations Chptr 1 Introduction |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=12 August 1949 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE1239F93AA25751C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=WAR IN THE GULF: P.O.W.'s; U.S. Says Prisoners Seem War-Weary | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=19 February 1991}}</ref>  In 2000, the U.S. military replaced the designation \"Prisoner of War\" with \"Missing-Captured\".

Bellot, \"Treatment of Prisoners of War\", ''Transactions of the Grotius Society'', Vol. 5, (1919), pp. 47–64.</ref> Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3 million men became prisoners.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.'' (1999) pp. 368–69 for data.</ref>  The [[German Empire]] held 2.5 million prisoners; [[Russian Empire|Russia]] held 2.9 million, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] held about 720,000, mostly gained in the period just before the [[Armistice]] in 1918. The US held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes shot down. Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations.  There was however much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador to Germany (prior to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in \"My Four Years in Germany\". Even worse conditions are reported in the book \"Escape of a Princess Pat\" by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2 million POWs held there died.<ref>\"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=PP7uMQdgv5AC&pg=PA240&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Disobedience and Conspiracy in the German Army, 1918–1945]''\".

[[Australian Flying Corps]] pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage through the Dardanelles in 1915.

The first British prisoners were released and reached [[Calais]] on 15 November. Plans were made for them to be sent via [[Dunkirk]] to [[Dover]] and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for [[demobilisation]].  On 13 December 1918 the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released ''en masse'' and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many released prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by [[cavalry]] troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.  Upon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and \"boarded\" before being dispatched to their own homes. All [[commissioned officer]]s had to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that they had done all they could to avoid capture.

This did not mean any change in status for Italian POWs however, since due to the labour shortages in the UK and the USA, they were retained as POWs there.<ref>Insolvibile Isabella, Wops. I prigionieri italiani in Gran Bretagna, Naples, Italy, Edizioni Scientifiche Italiane, 2012, ISBN 9788849523560</ref>  In September 1943, Italian officers were arrested and taken to German internment camps in East Europe, where they were held for the duration of WW2. The International Red Cross could do nothing for them, as they were not regarded as POW's, but the prisoners held the status of \"Military Internees\". Treatment of the prisoners was generally poor. The author Giovanni Guareschi was among those interned and wrote about this time in his life. The book was translated and published as \"My Secret Diary\". He wrote about the hungers of semi-starvation, the casual murder of individual prisoners by guards and how when they were released (now in a German camp) they found a deserted German town, filled with foodstuffs that they (with other released prisoners) ate.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}  ====Cossacks====  On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the United States and the United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation – The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=17 January 2012 }}</ref> The interpretation of this Agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets ([[Operation Keelhaul]]) regardless of their wishes.

The Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention.

Their POWs were housed in three camps, according to their potential usefulness to the North Korean army. Peace camps and reform camps were for POWs that were either sympathetic to the cause or who had valued skills that could be useful in the army and thus these enemy soldiers were indoctrinated and sometimes conscripted into the North Korean army. The regular prisoners of war were usually very poorly treated. POWs in peace camps were reportedly treated with more consideration.<ref name=\"Three\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kpows.com/thechineseconnection.html |title=Chinese operated three types of POW camps for Americans during the Korean War |date=April 1997 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref>  In 1952, the 1952 Inter-Camp P.O.W.

The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a ''person'', it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps [[security]] ([[confidentiality]]), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [[bodily integrity]].  The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the [[government]], [[corporation]]s or [[individual]]s is part of many countries' [[#Privacy law|privacy laws]], and in some cases, [[constitution]]s. Almost all countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning [[taxation]], which normally require the sharing of information about personal [[income]] or [[earnings]]. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with [[freedom of speech]] laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures.  Privacy may be [[Communication privacy management theory|voluntarily sacrificed]], normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used.<ref name=\"transparency\">{{cite journal|last=Oulasvirta |first=Antti |last2=Suomalainen |first2=Tiia |last3=Hamari |first3=Juho |last4=Lampinen |first4=Airi |last5=Karvonen |first5=Kristiina |date=2014 |title=Transparency of Intentions Decreases Privacy Concerns in Ubiquitous Surveillance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264638054_Transparency_of_Intentions_Decreases_Privacy_Concerns_in_Ubiquitous_Surveillance |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=633–638 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0585}}</ref> In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for [[advertising]] purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize.

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with [[Western culture]], British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times.

Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of ''уединение''—solitude, ''секретность''—secrecy, and ''частная жизнь''—private life) or borrow from English \"privacy\" (as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''Privasi'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''la privacy'').<ref name=\"TranslationToday\">{{cite book|title=Translation Today: Trends and Perspectives |last=Anderman |first=Gunilla M. |author2=Rogers, Margaret |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hJxVffwZEDgC&lpg=PA73&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q=privacy&f=false |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> The distinction hinges on the [[discrete]]ness of [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]] of parties (persons or groups), which can have [[emic and etic|emic]] variation depending on cultural mores of [[individualism]], [[collectivism]], and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]]. The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as \"when ''I'' withhold information, it is privacy; when ''you'' withhold information, it is secrecy.\"  ==Types of privacy== A broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=12-13}} One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=12-13}}  #The right to be let alone #the option to limit the access others have to one's personal information #[[secrecy]], or the option to conceal any information from others #control over others' use of information about oneself #the idea of [[personhood]] #protection of [[intimate relationships]]  ===Right to be let alone=== In 1890 the United States [[jurists]] [[Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]] wrote ''[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]'', an article in which they argued for the “right to be let alone”, using that phrase as a definition of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=15-17}} There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being “let alone”, and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose [[seclusion]] from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one’s own home.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=15-17}} Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=15-17}}  ===Limited access=== Limited access refers to a person’s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}  Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one’s personal information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}} [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] wrote in the late 19th century that “nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Godkin|first1=E.L.|authorlink1=Edwin Lawrence Godkin|title=Libel and its Legal Remedy|journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]]|date=December 1880|volume=46|issue=278|pages=729–739|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0046-6;didno=atla0046-6;view=image;seq=0735;node=atla0046-6%3A1}}</ref> Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison 9 years earlier,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gavison|first1=Ruth|authorlink1=Ruth Gavison|title=Privacy and the Limits of Law|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1980|pages=421–471}}</ref> [[Sissela Bok]] said that privacy is “the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others- either physical access, personal information, or attention.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bok|first1=Sissela|authorlink1=Sissela Bok|title=Secrets : on the ethics of concealment and revelation|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679724735|pages=10–11|edition=Vintage Books}}</ref>  ===Control over information=== Control over one's personal information is the concept that “privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}<ref>The quotation is from Alan Westin.{{cite book|last1=Westin|first1=Alan F.|last2=Blom-Cooper|first2=Louis|authorlink1=Alan Westin|authorlink2=Louis Blom-Cooper|title=Privacy and freedom|date=1970|publisher=Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-0370013251|page=7}}</ref> [[Charles Fried]] said that “Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fried|first1=Charles|authorlink1=Charles Fried|title=Privacy|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=January 1968|volume=77|issue=3|pages=475–493|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/794941}}</ref> Control over personal information is one of the more popular theories of the meaning of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}  ===Secrecy=== Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy.

Bloustein]] described this conception of privacy by saying that privacy serves to protect individuals from whatever is “demeaning to individuality”, “an affront to personal dignity”, or “an assault on human personality”.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=30}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bloustein|first1=Edward J.|authorlink1=Edward J.

This is an aspect of personal [[modesty]]. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of [[clothing|clothes]]. Other ways include erection of [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, screens, use of [[cathedral glass]], partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of [[physical intimacy]], but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.  Physical privacy could be defined as preventing \"intrusions into one's physical space or solitude.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BwQBT2Mr1YoC&pg=PA188&dq=physical+privacy&sig=dvybgqk6wfkf_xGimY8lvtWVV3I Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate America - H. Jeff]</ref> This would include concerns such as: * Preventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of [[modesty]]; apart from being [[clothing|dressed]] this can be achieved by [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, privacy screens, [[cathedral glass]], partitions between [[urinal (restroom)|urinals]], by being far away from others, on a bed by a [[bed sheet]] or a [[blanket]], when changing clothes by a [[towel]], etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being ''heard'' varies * Video, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts * Preventing searching of one's personal possessions * Preventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle * [[Medical privacy]], the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third-party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception  An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which guarantees \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 | work=Georgetown Law Journal | title=Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States | year=2002}}</ref>  Most countries have laws regarding [[trespassing]] and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.  Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or [[stalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |title=Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims |publisher=Privacyrights.org |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref> [[Civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.  ====Informational==== {{Main|Information privacy}}  Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self.  Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.  Various types of personal information are often associated with privacy concerns. Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability. First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available. Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation. An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability. Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else. This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it.  For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid [[discrimination]], personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.  [[Financial privacy]], in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of [[fraud]] including [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that [[Bank secrecy|does not share this information with other countries]] can help countries in fighting [[tax avoidance]].  [[Internet privacy]] is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used.  For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their [[email]] was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].  [[Medical privacy]] Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA] allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity.  A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to [[contraceptive security|acquire and use contraceptives]] without family, community or legal sanctions.  [[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered a basic right of [[citizenship]], despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).  Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations.  Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.  ====Organizational====  Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various [[security]] practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets.  For example, a government administration may be able to invoke [[executive privilege]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/amar/20040416.html |title=FindLaw's Writ - Amar: Executive Privilege |publisher=Writ.corporate.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref> or declare certain information to be [[Classified information|classified]], or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as [[trade secret]]s.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />  ====Spiritual and intellectual====  The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under [[British common law]], which protected \"only the physical interference of life and property.\" Its development from then on became \"one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law.\"<ref name=Solove>Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. ''Privacy, Information, and Technology'', Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9-11</ref>  Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a \"recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect.\"<ref name=Solove/> Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic \"right to be let alone\", and the former definition of \"property\" would then comprise \"every form of possession -- intangible, as well as tangible.\" By the late 19th century, interest in a \"right to privacy\" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.<ref name=Solove/>  ==History== {{further2|[[Privacy laws of the United States]]}}  ===Technology=== [[File:IllinoisTelephoneAndTelegraphAd.png|thumb|200px|Advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in [[Chicago]]. A major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was \"secret\", in that no operator was required to connect the call.]]  As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the [[printing press]] or the [[Internet]], the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the [[United States]] was the article by [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]], \"[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]\", [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html 4 ''Harvard Law Review'' 193 (1890)], that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.<ref>Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.&nbsp;P. [http://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&sort=relevancerank&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire]. and Bermann, S. (2007)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/privacy.htm |title=Privacy Law in the United States |publisher=Rbs2.com |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>  New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable. However, in 2001 in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'' (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of [[thermal imaging]] devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/ |title=Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>  Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large-scale [[information systems]] become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of [[information privacy]] has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. [[Privacy law]] in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient. Proposals such as the [[APEC]] Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.  There are various theories about privacy and privacy control. The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual. This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others. In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent. The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone’s concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance. The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a “right to privacy.” Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others. Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy. He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element. There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection. Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems. People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself. Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure. He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government. Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.  ===Internet=== {{Main|Internet privacy}}  The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: \"where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever\", writes law professor and author [[Jeffrey Rosen]].<ref name=Rosen>Rosen, Jeffrey. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=1&ref=technology \"The Web Means the End of Forgetting\"] ''New York Times'', July 19, 2010</ref>  This currently has an effect on employment. [[Microsoft]] reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and [[Twitter]]. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.<ref name=Rosen/>  The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. [[Facebook]] for example, as of July 2010, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 500 million members, or 22 percent of all Internet users, who upload over 25 billion pieces of content each month. [[Twitter]] has more than 100 million registered users. The [[Library of Congress]] recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.<ref name=Rosen/>  Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.<ref name=\"Kosinski 2013 5802–5805\">{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Stillwell, D. |author3=Graepel, T. |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=110|issue=15|pages=5802–5805|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Bachrach, Y. |author3=Stillwell, D.J. |author4=Kohli, P. |author5=Graepel, T. |title=Manifestations Of User Personality In Website Choice And Behaviour On Online Social Networks|journal=Machine Learning Journal|year=in press}}</ref> Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g. by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).

In 1960 legal scholar [[William Prosser]] created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Prosser|first1=William|authorlink1=William Prosser|title=Privacy|journal=[[California Law Review]]|date=1960|volume=48|issue=383|page=389|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol48/iss3/1}}</ref> #Intrusion into a person’s private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}} #public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}} #Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}} #Encroaching someone’s personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}  Building from this and other historical precedents, [[Daniel J. Solove]] presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}  ===Collecting information=== In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}  ===Aggregating information=== It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  *[[Data aggregation]], which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} *identification, which can mean breaking the [[de-identification]] of items of data by putting it through a [[de-anonymization]] process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} *insecurity, such as lack of [[data security]], which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a [[data breach]] which harms the people whose data it held{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} *secondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors’ [[informed consent]]{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} *exclusion is the use of a person's data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  ===Information dissemination=== Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  There are various examples of this.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person’s information private, then breaks that promise.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Appropriation is an attack on the [[personhood]] of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  ===Invasions=== [[Invasion of privacy]] is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is  an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} \"Decisional interference\" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  ==Right to privacy== {{main|Right to privacy}}  Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]] wrote that privacy is the \"right to be let alone\" (Warren & Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals.  This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as [[yellow journalism]].<ref name=Brandeis>Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 \"The Right To Privacy\"], 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890)</ref>  Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his [[Louis Brandeis#Creating a Right to Privacy|''Harvard Law Review'' article]] in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying \"the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader.\" He writes, \"Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.\" At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].  ===Definitions===  In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a \"right to privacy.\" Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy \"should not be defined as a separate legal right\" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.<ref name=Haifa>Yael Onn, et al., [http://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&pg=PA1&dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&hl=en&ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''] ,  Haifa Center of Law & Technology, (2005) pp. 1-12</ref> Other experts, such as [[William Prosser|Dean Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a \"common ground\" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.<ref name=Haifa/> One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of \"privacy in the digital environment\", suggests that the \"right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself.\" It has therefore proposed a working definition for a \"right to privacy\": <blockquote>''The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.''<ref name=Haifa/></blockquote>  ===An individual \"right\"===  [[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes.  Westin defines privacy as \"the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others\". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve.  These states must balance participation against norms: <blockquote> Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives. - Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968<ref>Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York, U.S.A.: Atheneum.</ref> </blockquote>  Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].  David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy.  He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves \"the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information\".  This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally.  Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, \"[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used\".<ref>Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.</ref>  Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control.  Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency.  For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.<ref>Posner, R. A. (1981). The economics of privacy. The American Economic Review, 71(2), 405-409.</ref> For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law.  Lessig claims \"the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right\", and that \"individuals should be able to control information about themselves\".<ref>Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.</ref>  Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.  ===A collective value and a human right===  There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–442|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editor=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}</ref>   [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy.

He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance by weakening informal social controls.<ref>Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897-905.</ref> Furthermore, the government is no longer the only or even principle threat to people's privacy. Etzioni notes that corporate data miners, or \"[http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf Privacy Merchants],\"{{Dead link|date=December 2014}} stand to profit by selling massive dossiers personal information, including purchasing decisions and Internet traffic, to the highest bidder. And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Etzioni|first=Amitai|title=The Privacy Merchants: What is to be done?|journal=The Journal of Constitutional Law|date=March 2012|volume=14|issue=4|page=950|url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf}}</ref>  Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy.  She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components.  Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought.  Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power.  Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided.  Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: \"if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection\".<ref>Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.</ref>  Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy.  Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context.  The human right to privacy has precedent in the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\"<ref>United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html</ref>  Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.<ref>Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society, 28(1), 80-91.</ref>  ==Protection== [[File:Privacy International 2007 privacy ranking map.png|thumb|300px|[[Privacy International]] 2007 privacy ranking<br/>green: Protections and safeguards<br/>red: Endemic surveillance societies]]  Most countries give citizen rights to privacy in their constitutions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}} Representative examples of this include the ''[[Constitution of Brazil]]'', which says “the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable”; the ''[[Constitution of South Africa]]'' says that “everyone has a right to privacy”; and the ''[[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]'' says “the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}} Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}}  Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia’s [[Privacy Act 1988]], Argentina’s Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada’s 2000 [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and Japan’s 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}}  Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3}} The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] says “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The [[European Union]]'s 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] guides privacy protection in Europe.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}} The 2004 Privacy Framework by the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}}  In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}} [[Vance Packard]]’s ''[[The Naked Society]]'' was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}}  ===Free market versus consumer protection approaches=== Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.<ref name=\"quinn\">{{cite book | title=Ethics for the Information Age  | author=Quinn, Michael J.  | year=2009  | isbn=0-321-53685-1 }}</ref>  In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share.  Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices.  Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.  In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available.  In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.<ref name=\"Jensen\">{{cite journal | title= Privacy policies as decision-making tools: an evaluation of online privacy notices | author=Jensen, Carlos | year=2004 }}</ref> Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.  ===Privacy law=== {{Main|Privacy law}}  Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals.  While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries.  For example, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 12, states:  :''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''  ====Australia==== {{main |Privacy in Australian law}}  In [[Australia]] there is the [[Privacy Act 1988]]. Privacy sector provisions of the Act apply to private sector organisations with a link to Australia, including: 1. individuals who collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of a business. For example, a sole trader's business activities will be regulated (unless it's a small business), but information gathered outside business activities won't be; 2. bodies corporate; and 3. partnerships, unincorporated associations and trusts - any act or practice of a partner, committee member or trustee is attributed to the organisation. Organisations outside Australia must comply with the provisions in some circumstances. Sending information out of Australia is also regulated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privacy.gov.au/law/act |title=Privacy Act |publisher=Privacy.gov.au |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>  ====Brazil==== The [[Constitution of Brazil]] sets privacy as a major fundamental right. Even the State is not allowed to violate personal data, intimacy, private life, honor and image (article 5, incise X). In extreme situations, a judicial order can authorize some level of disclosure. But some data, such as correspondence, are absolutely inviolable, and not even judicial order can authorize the disclosure.  ====Canada==== {{main |Canadian privacy law}}  [[Canadian privacy law]] is governed federally by multiple acts, including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act (Canada)]].  Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations. [[Data privacy]] was first addressed with the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.  ====European Union==== For [[Europe]], Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The [[European Union]] requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data]]. It is regulated in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]]  and in France [[data protection]] is also monitored by the [[CNIL]], a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before them being enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.  Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws.<ref>Burghardt, Buchmann, Böhm, Kühling, Sivridis''A Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts'' Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009.</ref> The European Union is also championing for the 'Right to be Forgotten' concept (which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from internet search engine results) to be adopted by other countries.<ref>http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/french-official-campaigns-to-make-right-to-be-forgotten-global/?ref=technology</ref>  ====Italy==== In [[Italy]] the [[right to privacy]] is enshrined in Article 15 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]], which states:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}</ref>  \"Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication is inviolable. Limitations may only be imposed by judicial decision stating the reasons and in accordance with the guarantees provided by the law.\"  ====United Kingdom==== {{main |Privacy in English law}}  In the [[United Kingdom]], it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another [[tort]] (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4482073.stm Does Beckham judgment change rules?], from [[BBC News]] (retrieved 27 April 2005).</ref> There is, however, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]; [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]; [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003]]. The ICO has also provided a \"Personal Information Toolkit\" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.<ref>[http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf \"Personal Information Toolkit\"] prepared by the Information Commissioner’s Office, UK.</ref>  ====United States==== {{main |Privacy laws of the United States}}  Concerning [[privacy laws of the United States]], individual as well as locational privacy is guaranteed by the [[Constitution of the United States]] under the 4th amendment of the constitution  .  The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has found that other guarantees have \"penumbras\" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965). In the United States, the right of [[freedom of speech]] granted in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the U.S. by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], and various state laws. Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA),<ref>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.</ref> the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLB), and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA). <ref>[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]</ref>  ===Privacy Index=== The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'s Privacy Index puts Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa in the higher level of privacy (around 2.2).

For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via [[S/MIME]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.<ref name=\"FederalTrade\">Federal Trade Commission (2010), \"Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers,\" Preliminary FTC Staff Report (December), available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf].</ref>  Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party [[HTTP cookies]], Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at [[Florida International University]] and privacy scholar, warns that the \"elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies.\"<ref>Miyazaki, Anthony D.

Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: \"first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short\".<ref>Hugl, Ulrike (2011), \"Reviewing Person’s Value of Privacy of Online Social Networking,\" ''Internet Research'', 21(4), in press, http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1066-2243&volume=21&issue=4&articleid=1926600&show=abstract.</ref> This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.<ref name=\"Kosinski 2013 5802–5805\"/>  ===Privacy and location-based services===  As location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are increasing, problems related to user privacy arise, since user's position and preferences constitute personal information and improper use of them violates user's privacy.

The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.  Several methods to protect user's privacy when using [[location-based service]]s have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to be able to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.<ref>Athanasios S.

Local abundance varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The primary cause of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy (but see [[chemosynthesis]]), confining primary production to surface waters, and to geographical regions and seasons having abundant light.  A secondary variable is nutrient availability. Although large areas of the [[tropics|tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] oceans have abundant light, they experience relatively low primary production because they offer limited nutrients such as [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[silicate]]. This results from large-scale [[ocean current|ocean circulation]] and water column [[Stratification (water)|stratification]]. In such regions, primary production usually occurs at greater depth, although at a reduced level (because of reduced light).  Despite significant [[macronutrient]] concentrations, some ocean regions are unproductive (so-called [[HNLC|HNLC regions]]).<ref>{{Cite journal    | last = Martin | first = J.

Paradoxically, oceanic areas adjacent to unproductive, [[arid]] land thus typically have abundant phytoplankton (e.g., the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]], where [[trade winds]] bring dust from the [[Sahara Desert]] in north [[Africa]]). While plankton are most abundant in surface waters, they live throughout the water column. At depths where no primary production occurs, [[zooplankton]] and [[bacterioplankton]] instead consume organic material sinking from more productive surface waters above. This flux of sinking material, so-called [[marine snow]], can be especially high following the termination of [[spring bloom]]s.

It might be possible to increase the ocean's uptake of [[Carbon dioxide#In the Earth.27s atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] generated through [[anthropogenic|human activities]] by increasing  plankton production through ''[[Iron fertilization|seeding]]'', primarily with the [[micronutrient]] [[iron]]. However, this technique may not be practical at a large scale. Ocean [[Anoxic sea water|oxygen depletion]] and resultant [[methanogen|methane production]] (caused by the excess production [[remineralisation|remineralising]] at depth) is one potential drawback.<ref>{{Cite journal    | last = Chisholm | first = S.W.    | year = 2001    | title = Dis-crediting ocean fertilization | journal = Science | volume = 294    | issue = 5541 | pages = 309–310    | doi = 10.1126/science.1065349    | pmid = 11598285    | last2 = Falkowski    | first2 = PG    | last3 = Cullen    | first3 = JJ | displayauthors = 1    }}</ref><ref> {{Cite journal    | last = Aumont | first = O. |author2=Bopp, L.   | year = 2006 | url = http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2005GB002591.shtml | title = Globalizing results from ocean ''in situ'' iron fertilization studies | journal = Global Biogeochemical Cycles | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1029/2005GB002591 | pages = GB2017 | bibcode=2006GBioC..20.2017A }}</ref>  ===Biomass variability=== The growth of phytoplankton populations is dependent on light levels and nutrient availability.  The chief factor limiting growth varies from region to region in the world's oceans.  On a broad scale, growth of phytoplankton in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical gyres is generally limited by nutrient supply, while light often limits phytoplankton growth in subarctic gyres.  Environmental variability at multiple scales influences the nutrient and light available for phytoplankton, and as these organisms form the base of the marine food web, this variability in phytoplankton growth influences higher trophic levels.  For example, at interannual scales phytoplankton levels temporarily plummet during [[El Niño]] periods, influencing populations of zooplankton, fishes, sea birds, and [[marine mammal]]s.  The effects of anthropogenic warming on the global population of phytoplankton is an area of active research.  Changes in the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent biological reactions, and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important impacts on future phytoplankton productivity.<ref>Steinacher, M., et al. (2010), Projected 21st century decrease in marine productivity: a multi-model analysis, Biogeosciences, 7, 979-1005</ref>  Additionally, changes in the mortality of phytoplankton due to rates of zooplankton grazing may be significant.  Freshly hatched fish larvae are also plankton for a few days, as long as it takes before they can swim against currents.  <gallery> File:Amphipodredkils.jpg|An [[amphipoda|amphipod]]: an exoskeletoned animal with curved body, with two long and two short antennae.

From the Thau Lagoon of Sète, France </gallery>  == Importance to fish == Zooplankton are the initial prey item for almost all [[fish larva]]e as they switch from their [[yolk]] sacs to external feeding. Fish rely on the density and distribution of zooplankton to match that of new larvae, which can otherwise starve.  Natural factors (e.g., current variations) and man-made factors (e.g. river dams) can strongly affect zooplankton, which can in turn strongly affect larval survival, and therefore breeding success.  == See also == * [[Aeroplankton]] * [[Algal bloom]] * [[Biological pump]] * [[Gelatinous zooplankton]] * [[Holoplankton]] * [[Ichthyoplankton]] * [[Iron fertilization]] * [[Meroplankton]] * [[Nekton]] * [[Ocean acidification]] * [[Paradox of the plankton]] * [[Phytoplankton]] * [[Primary production]] * [[Seston]] * [[Veliger]] * [[Zooplankton]]  == References == {{reflist|2}}  ==Further reading== *Kirby, Richard R.

Only a few physicists, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], have been successful in both roles. Lacking an aptitude or interest in experimental work, many theorists have earned a reputation for accidentally breaking experimental equipment. Pauli was exceptional in this regard: it was said that he was such a good theorist that any experiments would self-destruct simply because he was in the vicinity. For fear of the Pauli effect, the experimental physicist [[Otto Stern]] banned Pauli from his laboratory in [[Hamburg]] despite their friendship.<ref>Enz (2009), p. 152.</ref> Pauli was convinced that the effect named after him was real.<ref name=\"Enz2002-150\">Enz (2002), p. 150.</ref> He corresponded with [[Carl Jung]] and [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] about the concept of [[synchronicity]] and did so as well with [[Hans Bender]], lecturer at Freiburg university Institut für Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene, the only [[parapsychology]] chair in Germany.<ref>Hans Bender und die Gründung des \"Instituts für Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene\"Eberhard Bauer, September 1997. published in Jahnke, J., Fahrenberg, J., Stegie, R., & Bauer, E.

An expensive measuring device, for no apparent reason, suddenly stopped working, although Pauli was in fact ''absent''.

However, it turned out that Pauli on a railway journey to Copenhagen switched trains in Göttingen rail station about the time of failure.

He has been called \"the godfather of British comics\".<ref>Molcher, M: \"Pat Mills – the Guv'nor\", ''Judge Dredd Megazine'', #261</ref>  His comics are notable for their violence and anti-authoritarianism. He is best known for creating ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' and playing a major part in the development of ''[[Judge Dredd]]''.  ==Biography==  Mills started his career as a sub-editor for [[D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd]], where he met Wagner. In 1971 both left to go [[freelance]], and were soon writing scripts for [[IPC Media|IPC]]'s girls' and humour comics. After D.C. Thomson launched ''[[Warlord (comic)|Warlord]]'', a successful war-themed weekly, Mills was asked in 1975 to develop a rival title for IPC. Based in the girls' comics department to avoid the attention of the staff of the boys' department, Mills, along with Wagner and [[Gerry Finley-Day]], worked in secret to create ''[[Battle Picture Weekly]]''. ''Battle'''s stories were more violent and its characters more working class than IPC's traditional fare, and it was an immediate hit. Having made the comic ready for launch, Mills resigned as editor. He would later write the celebrated [[First World War]] series ''[[Charley's War]]'', drawn by [[Joe Colquhoun]], for the title.  After launching ''Battle'', Mills began developing a new boys' title, ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', launched in 1976. ''Action'''s mix of violence and anti-authoritarianism proved controversial and the title lasted less than two years before being withdrawn in the face of media protests. It was briefly revived in neutered form before being merged into ''Battle''.  His next creation was the science fiction-themed weekly ''2000 AD'', launched in 1977. As with ''Battle'' and ''Action'' he developed most of the early series before handing them over to other writers. He took over the development of ''Judge Dredd'' when creator John Wagner temporarily walked out, and wrote many of the early stories, establishing the character and his world, before Wagner returned.  In 1978 IPC launched ''[[Starlord]]'', a short-lived companion title for ''2000 AD''. Mills contributed ''[[Ro-Busters]]'', a series about a robot disaster squad, which moved to ''2000 AD'' when ''Starlord'' was cancelled.  ''Ro-Busters'' was the beginning of a mini-universe of interrelated stories Mills was to create for ''2000 AD'', including ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' and ''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]''. Artist [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] was involved in the creation of all three. ''Nemesis'' in particular, featuring a morally ambiguous alien hero fighting a despotic human empire, allowed Mills to work out his feelings towards religion and imperialism. Another strand of his ''2000 AD'' work was ''[[Sláine (comics)|Sláine]]'', a [[barbarian]] fantasy based on [[Celtic mythology]] and [[neo-paganism]], which he co-created with his then wife [[Angela Kincaid]] (with whom he also created the children's series of books, ''[[The Butterfly Children]]'').  Mills also had a hand in IPC's line of Horror comics aimed at girls such as ''[[Chiller (comics)|Chiller]]''.  He has had little success in American comics, with the exception of [[Marshal Law]], a savage [[superhero]] satire published by [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Epic Comics|Epic]] imprint in the late 1980s, drawn by O'Neill.  In 1986 he edited the short-lived comic ''[[Dice Man (comics)|Dice Man]]'', which featured characters from ''2000 AD''. He wrote nearly every story.  In 1988 he was involved in the launch of ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', a politically aware ''2000 AD'' spin-off aimed at older readers. For it he wrote ''[[Third World War (comics)|Third World War]]'', drawn initially by [[Carlos Ezquerra]], a polemical critique of global capitalism and the ways it exploits the developing world. The title lasted until 1991 and launched the careers of talents such as [[Garth Ennis]], [[John Smith (comics)|John Smith]] and [[Sean Phillips]].  In 1991 Mills launched ''[[Toxic!]]'', an independent colour newsstand weekly comic with a violent, anarchic tone, perhaps as a reaction against the politically worthy ''Crisis'', and a [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] ideal. Many of the stories were created by Mills and co-writer [[Tony Skinner]], including ''[[Accident Man]]'', an assassin who makes his hits look like accidents. ''Toxic!'' lasted less than a year, but gave a start to talents such as [[Duke Mighten]] and [[Martin Emond]].  In 1995, he broke in the French market, one of his life's goals, with ''Sha'', created with French artist [[Olivier Ledroit]].  He continues to write ''Sláine'', ''[[Bill Savage]]'', ''Black Siddha'' and ''ABC Warriors'' for ''2000 AD'', and also the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comic]] ''[[Requiem Chevalier Vampire|Requiem Vampire Knight]]'', with art by [[Olivier Ledroit]] and its spin-off [[Claudia Chevalier Vampire]], with art by [[Franck Tacito]].  Two new series, ''[[Greysuit]]'', a super-powered government agent drawn by [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]], and ''[[Defoe (comics)|Defoe]]'', a 17th-century zombie hunter drawn by [[Leigh Gallagher]], began in ''2000 AD'' prog 1540.<ref>[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=news&page=newsimage&choice=2kjun07 2000AD Online – news zone<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Mills has formed Repeat Offenders with artist [[Clint Langley]] and Jeremy Davis \"to develop graphic novel concepts with big-screen potential\" and the first project is a graphic novel called ''[[American Reaper]]'', serialised in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' (#316-ongoing as of October 2011).

The first audio play was released as the first part of the second season of the [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Eighth Doctor New Adventures|Eighth Doctor Adventures]] and the second as part of the third season.

It is one of the country's three [[Capital (political)|capital cities]], serving as the executive (administrative) and de facto national capital ([[Cape Town]] is the [[legislature|legislative]] capital and [[Bloemfontein]] the [[judicial]] capital). Pretoria is the central part of the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]] which was formed by the amalgamation of several former local authorities including  [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]] and [[Soshanguve]]). There have been proposals to change the name of Pretoria itself to Tshwane, and the [[Pretoria#Change of name|proposed name change]] has caused some controversy.  Pretoria is named after the [[Voortrekker]] leader [[Andries Pretorius]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Raper|first=Peter E.|title=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names|url=http://archive.org/stream/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames/SaPlaceNames#page/n373/mode/2up|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=28 August 2013|page=373|year=1987}}</ref> and within South Africa is popularly known as the Jacaranda City due to the thousands of [[Jacaranda]] trees planted in its streets, parks and gardens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/provinces.htm#gauteng |title=South Africa's provinces: Gauteng |accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>  ==History== [[File:Pretorius.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue of Andries Wilhelmus Jacobus Pretorius (27 November 1798 – 23 July 1853) in Pretoria]] <div style=\"float:right;clear:right;\"> [[File:Union-buildings-pretoria.JPG|thumb|The [[Union Buildings]], seat of South Africa's government]] [[File:Palace of Justice - Pretoria.jpg|thumb|The Palace of Justice]] [[File:RSA Pretoria 2.jpg|thumb|Old Counsel Chambers or the \"Raadsaal\" of the ZAR]]</div>  Pretoria was founded in 1855 by [[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius|Marthinus Pretorius]], a leader of the [[Voortrekkers]], who named it after his father [[Andries Pretorius]] and chose a spot on the banks of the \"Apies rivier\" ([[Afrikaans]] for \"Monkeys river\") to be the new [[capital city|capital]] of the [[South African Republic]](Z.A.R.). The elder Pretorius had become a national hero of the [[Voortrekkers]] after his victory over the [[Dingane]] and the [[Zulu people|Zulus]] in the [[Battle of Blood River]]. [[Andries Pretorius]] also negotiated the [[Sand River Convention]] (1852), in which Britain acknowledged the independence of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. It became the capital of the [[South African Republic]] (ZAR) on 1 May 1860. The founding of Pretoria as the capital of the South African Republic can be seen as marking the end of the Boers' settlement movements of the [[Great Trek]].  ===Boer Wars=== {{Main|Boer Wars}} {{See also|Pretoria Forts}} During the [[First Boer War]], the city was besieged by Republican forces in December 1880 and March 1881. The peace treaty which ended the war was signed in Pretoria on 3 August 1881 at the [[Pretoria Convention]].  The [[Second Boer War]] (1899 to 1902) resulted in the end of the [[Transvaal Republic]] and start of British [[hegemony]] in South Africa. During the war, [[Winston Churchill]] was imprisoned in the [[Staats Model School]] in Pretoria but escaped to [[Mozambique]]. The city surrendered to British forces under [[Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Frederick Roberts]] on 5 June 1900 and the conflict was ended in Pretoria with the signing of the [[Peace of Vereeniging]] on 31 May 1902.  The [[Pretoria Forts]] were built for the defence of the city just prior to the Second Boer War. Though some of these forts are today in ruins, a number of them have been preserved as national monuments.  ===Union of South Africa=== {{Main|Union of South Africa}} The Boer Republics of the ZAR and the [[Orange River Colony]] were united with the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and [[Natal Colony]] in 1910 to become the [[Union of South Africa]]. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital. Between 1910 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. (As the capital of the ZAR, Pretoria had superseded [[Potchefstroom]] in that role.)  On 14 October 1931, Pretoria achieved official city status.<ref>South African History Online, [http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/pretoria-receives-city-status], 2011]</ref> When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria remained its administrative capital.  ==Geography== [[File:Pretoria, RSA from above.PNG|thumb|left|Satellite image of Pretoria.]] Pretoria is situated approximately {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of [[Johannesburg]] in the northeast of South Africa, in a transitional belt between the plateau of the [[Highveld]] to the south and the lower-lying [[Bushveld]] to the north. It lies at an altitude of about {{convert|1,339|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]],<ref>[http://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm ''Elevation Finder - freemaptools.com'', Elevation of the City Hall in Pretoria, 4 July 2014]</ref> in a warm, sheltered, fertile valley, surrounded by the hills of the [[Magaliesberg]] range. [[File:Magaliesberg08.jpg|thumb|The City is surrounded by the Magaliesberg Mountain range.]]  ===Climate=== The city has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with long hot rainy summers and short cool to cold,dry winters. The city experiences the typical winters of South Africa with cold, clear nights and mild to moderately warm days. Although the average lows during winter are mild it can get bitterly cold due to the clear skies and this in recent years have caused Pretoria to experience temperatures in the range of 2C to -5C at night.The average annual temperature is {{convert|18.7|°C|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate data, 30-year climate average 1979–2008, Goddard Institute of Space Studies</ref> This is rather high considering its relatively high altitude of about 1339 metres and is due mainly to its sheltered valley position, which acts as a heat trap and cuts it off from cool southerly and south-easterly air masses for much of the year. Rain is chiefly concentrated in the summer months, with drought conditions prevailing over the winter months, when frosts may be sharp. Snowfall is an extremely rare event; snowflakes were spotted in 1959, 1968 and 2012 in the city, but the city has never experienced an accumulation in its history. During a nationwide heatwave in November 2011, Pretoria experienced temperatures that reached {{convert|39|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, unusual for that time of the year. Similar record-breaking extreme heat events also occurred in January 2013, when Pretoria experienced temperatures exceeding {{convert|37|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} on several days. The all-time high recorded in Pretoria was {{convert|42|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} on 25 January 2013. The year 2014 saw one of the wettest years on record for the city. A total of {{convert|914|mm|0|abbr=on}} fell up to end December with {{convert|220|mm|0|abbr=on}} recorded in this month alone.  {{Weather box |location = Pretoria |metric first = Yes |single line = Yes |Jan record high C = 42 |Feb record high C = 37 |Mar record high C = 35 |Apr record high C = 33 |May record high C = 29 |Jun record high C = 25 |Jul record high C = 26 |Aug record high C = 31 |Sep record high C = 37 |Oct record high C = 39 |Nov record high C = 39 |Dec record high C = 37 |year record high C = 42 |Jan high C = 29 |Feb high C = 28 |Mar high C = 27 |Apr high C = 24 |May high C = 22 |Jun high C = 19 |Jul high C = 20 |Aug high C = 22 |Sep high C = 26 |Oct high C = 27 |Nov high C = 27 |Dec high C = 28 |year high C = 25 |Jan mean C = 23.5 |Feb mean C = 22.5 |Mar mean C = 21.5 |Apr mean C = 18 |May mean C = 15 |Jun mean C = 12 |Jul mean C = 12.5 |Aug mean C = 15 |Sep mean C = 19 |Oct mean C = 20.5 |Nov mean C = 21.5 |Dec mean C = 22.5 |year mean C = 18.6 |Jan low C = 18 |Feb low C = 17 |Mar low C = 16 |Apr low C = 12 |May low C = 8 |Jun low C = 5 |Jul low C = 5 |Aug low C = 8 |Sep low C = 12 |Oct low C = 14 |Nov low C = 16 |Dec low C = 17 |year low C = 12 |Jan record low C = 8 |Feb record low C = 11 |Mar record low C = 6 |Apr record low C = 3 |May record low C = -1 |Jun record low C = -6 |Jul record low C = -4 |Aug record low C = -1 |Sep record low C = 2 |Oct record low C = 4 |Nov record low C = 7 |Dec record low C = 7 |year record low C = -6 |Jan precipitation mm = 154 |Feb precipitation mm = 75 |Mar precipitation mm = 82 |Apr precipitation mm = 51 |May precipitation mm = 13 |Jun precipitation mm = 7 |Jul precipitation mm = 3 |Aug precipitation mm = 6 |Sep precipitation mm = 22 |Oct precipitation mm = 71 |Nov precipitation mm = 98 |Dec precipitation mm = 150 |year precipitation mm = 733 |Jan precipitation days = 14 |Feb precipitation days = 11 |Mar precipitation days = 10 |Apr precipitation days = 7 |May precipitation days = 3 |Jun precipitation days = 1 |Jul precipitation days = 1 |Aug precipitation days = 2 |Sep precipitation days = 3 |Oct precipitation days = 9 |Nov precipitation days = 12 |Dec precipitation days = 15 |year precipitation days = 87 |Jan sun = 261 |Feb sun = 235 |Mar sun = 254 |Apr sun = 246 |May sun = 283 |Jun sun = 271 |Jul sun = 289 |Aug sun = 296 |Sep sun = 284 |Oct sun = 275 |Nov sun = 254 |Dec sun = 272 |year sun = 3220 |source 1 = South African Weather Service<ref name=\"saws-climstats\">{{cite web |url = http://old.weathersa.co.za/Climat/Climstats/PretoriaStats.jsp |title = Climate data for Pretoria |accessdate = 6 March 2010 |publisher=South African Weather Service|date=June 2011}}</ref> |date=August 2010 |source 2 = The Weather Network (sun only) <ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.theweathernetwork.com/statistics/c01861 |title = Climate Statistics for Pretoria, South Africa |accessdate = 24 March 2012}}</ref> }}  ==Demographics== [[File:Tshwane population density map.svg|thumb|Population density in and around Pretoria {{Columns |col1 = {{legend|#ffffcc|&lt;1 /km²}} {{legend|#ffeda0|1–3 /km²}} {{legend|#fed976|3–10 /km²}} {{legend|#feb24c|10–30 /km²}} {{legend|#fd8d3c|30–100 /km²}} |col2= {{legend|#fc4e2a|100–300 /km²}} {{legend|#e31a1c|300–1000 /km²}} {{legend|#bc0026|1000–3000 /km²}} {{legend|#800026|&gt;3000 /km²}}}}]] [[File:Tshwane dominant language map.svg|thumb|right|Geographical distribution of home languages in Pretoria {{Columns |col1= {{legend|#8dd3c7|[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]}} {{legend|#ffffb3|[[South African English|English]]}} {{legend|#bebada|[[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]}} {{legend|#80b1d3|[[Zulu language|Zulu]]}} |col2= {{legend|#fdb462|[[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]]}} {{legend|#fccde5|[[Tswana language|Tswana]]}} {{legend|#ffed6f|[[Tsonga language|Tsonga]]}} {{legend|#d0d0d0|None dominant}}}}]] Depending on the extent of the area understood to constitute \"Pretoria\", the population ranges from 500,000<ref>Population, according to the 2001 Census, of the [http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/77612 Pretoria \"main place\"].</ref> to 2.95&nbsp;million.<ref>Population, according to the [http://www.statssa.gov.za/Publications/P03011/P030112007.pdf 2007 Community Survey], of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality after the 2011 annexation of the Metsweding District Municipality.</ref> The main language spoken in Pretoria is [[Afrikaans]]; also widely spoken are [[Pedi language|Pedi]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Setswana language|Tswana]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and English. The city of Pretoria has the largest white population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since its founding it has been a major [[Afrikaner]] population centre, and currently there are roughly 1 million Afrikaners living in or around the city.  Even since the end of Apartheid, Pretoria itself still has a white majority, albeit an ever increasing black middle-class. However, in the townships of [[Soshanguve]] and [[Atteridgeville]] blacks make up close to all of the population. The largest white ethnic group are the Afrikaners and the largest black ethnic group are the [[Northern Sotho people|Northern Sotho]]s.  The lower estimate for the population of Pretoria includes largely former white-designated areas and there is therefore a white majority. However, including the geographically separate townships increases Pretoria's population beyond a million and makes whites a minority.  Pretoria's [[Indian South Africans|Indians]] were ordered to move from Pretoria to [[Laudium]] on 6 June 1958.<ref>[http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/transfer-indian-community-pretoria-laudium-ordered South African History Online]</ref>  ==Cityscape==  ===Architecture=== {{See also|Pretoria Forts}} :''{{Commons category-inline||bullet=none|Buildings in Pretoria}}''  Pretoria has over the years had very diverse cultural influences and this is reflected in the architectural styles that can be found in the city. It ranges from 19th century Dutch, German and British Colonial Architecture to [[Modern architecture|modern]], [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], [[neomodern]], and [[Art Deco|art deco]] architecture styles with a good mix of a uniquely South African style.  Some of the notable structures in Pretoria include the late 19th century [[Palace of Justice (South Africa)|Palace of Justice]], the early 20th century [[Union Buildings]], the post-war [[Voortrekker Monument]], the diverse buildings dotting the main campuses of both the [[University of Pretoria]] and the [[University of South Africa]], traditional [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch]] style [[Mahlamba Ndlopfu]] (the President's House), the more modern Reserve Bank of South Africa (Office skyscraper) and the Telkom Lukas Rand Transmission Tower. Other well-known structures and buildings include the [[Loftus Versfeld Stadium]], The South African [[State Theatre, South Africa|State Theatre]] and the Oliver Tambo building which is the Headquarters of the [[Department of International Relations and Cooperation]] (which is a good example of neomodern architecture in South Africa). <gallery> File:Union_Buildings_Eastern_Wing.jpg|The Eastern Wing of the Union Buildings |A typical streetscape in 'The Jacaranda City' File:Fort Klapperkop.jpg|[[Pretoria Forts|Fort Klapperkop]] File:Neomodernist facade in Pretoria.JPG|[[Neomodern]] architecture in Pretoria File:9 2 258 0013-Law Chambers-Palace of Justice-Pretoria-s.jpg| The Palace of Justice | Brooklyn Bridge in eastern Pretoria File:Jacarandas smaller picture.png| The Jacaranda lined streets of Pretoria </gallery>  ===Central business district=== [[File:Skyline-of-pretoria.jpg|thumb|The Central Business District]] [[File:Pta zoo.jpg|thumb|The view from the Pretoria Zoo cable car ride]] Despite the many corporate offices, small businesses, shops and government departments that are situated in [[List of Pretoria suburbs|Pretoria's sprawling suburbs]], its Central Business District still retains its status as the traditional centre of government and commerce. Many banks, businesses, large corporations, shops, shopping centres and other businesses are situated in the city centre which is towered by several large skyscrapers, the tallest of which is the Poyntons Building (110m tall), the ABSA Building (132 m tall) and the Reserve Bank of South Africa building (150m tall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/southafricanreservebankbuilding-pretoria-southafrica |title=South African Reserve Bank Building, Pretoria &#124; Building 103551 |location=Pretoria / |publisher=Emporis |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref>  The area contains a large amount of historical buildings, monuments and museums that include the [[Pretoria City Hall]], Pretorius Square, Church Square (Along with its many historical buildings and statues) and the [[Ou Raadsaal]].

The routes, originating from the city centre, extend south to [[Germiston]] and [[Johannesburg]], west to [[Atteridgeville]], northwest to [[Ga-Rankuwa]], north to [[Soshanguve]] and east to [[Mamelodi]].  The [[Gautrain]] high-speed railway line runs from the eastern suburb of [[Hatfield, Pretoria|Hatfield]] to [[Pretoria railway station|Pretoria Station]] and then southwards to [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]], [[Midrand]], [[Marlboro, Gauteng|Marlboro]], [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[OR Tambo International Airport]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]] and [[Parktown]].

It enters the city from the south as the Ben Schoeman Highway. At the Brakfontein Interchange with the [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]] it continues as The N1 Eastern Bypass bisects the large expanse of the eastern suburbs, routing traffic from [[Johannesburg]] to [[Polokwane]] and the north of the country. The [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]] is the original N1, and served the same function before the construction of the highway. It runs through the centre of town rather than the eastern suburbs.  The [[N4 road (South Africa)|N4]] enters the town as a highway from [[Witbank]] in the east, merging with the N1 at the Proefplaas Interchange. It begins again north of the city, branching west from the N1 as the Platinum Highway, forming the Northern Bypass, and heading to [[Rustenburg]]. The N4 runs east-west through South Africa, connecting [[Maputo]] to [[Gaborone]]. Before the Platinum Highway was built, the N4 continued passed the Proefplaas Interchange to the city centre, where it became a regular road, before again becoming a highway west of the city. These roads are now designated the M2 and M4. There is a third, original east-west road: the [[R104 road (South Africa)|R104]], Church Street. Church Street is in the process of being renamed to a number of new names.  The [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]] starts in the centre of town from the M4 (former N4). It is a normal road heading south through the centre before becoming the Ben Schoeman highway. At the Brakfontein interchange, the Ben Schoeman highway becomes the N1, but the N14 continues as the intersecting west-south-western highway towards [[Krugersdorp]]. The [[R114 road (South Africa)|R114]] parallels the N14 in its westward journey running just to the north of the highway.  The [[R21 road (South Africa)|R21]] provides a second north-south highway, further east. It starts from the Fountains Interchange south of the city centre, but is still a road until Monument Park, when it becomes a true highway. It crosses the N1 east of the Brakfontein Interchange at the Flying Saucer Interchange and runs north/south towards [[Ekurhuleni]] (specifically [[Kempton Park, Gauteng|Kempton Park]] and [[Boksburg]]). Importantly it links Pretoria with the [[OR Tambo International Airport]] in Kempton Park.  A proposed third north-south highway, in the west of the city, the [[R80 road (South Africa)|R80]] is partially built. At present the highway begins in [[Soshanguve]]. It terminates just north of the city centre at an intersection with the M1. Plans have been in place for some time to extend this all the way past the M4 and N14 highways to the N1 in Randburg.  Pretoria is also served by many regional roads. The [[R55 road (South Africa)|R55]] starts at an interchange with the R80, and runs north-south west of the city to [[Sandton]]. The [[R50 road (South Africa)|R50]] starts from the N1 just after the Flying Saucer Interchange in the south-east of the city, and continues south-east towards [[Delmas, Mpumalanga|Delmas]]. The [[R511 road (South Africa)|R511]] runs north-south from [[Randburg]] towards [[Brits, North-West|Brits]] and barely by-passes Pretoria to the west. The [[R514 road (South Africa)|R514]] starts from the M1, north of the city centre, and terminates at the R511. The [[R513 road (South Africa)|R513]] crosses Pretoria's northern suburbs from east to west. It links Pretoria to [[Cullinan, Gauteng|Cullinan]] and [[Bronkhorstspruit]] in the east and [[Hartbeespoort]] in the west. The [[R566 road (South Africa)|R566]] takes origin in Pretoria's northern suburbs, and exits the town to the west just north of the R513. It connects Pretoria to [[Brits, North West|Brits]]. Finally the [[R573 road (South Africa)|R573]] starts from the R513, just east of the town and heads north-east to [[Siyabuswa]].  Pretoria is also served internally by [[Metropolitan Routes in Pretoria|metropolitan routes]].  ===Airports=== For scheduled air services, Pretoria is served by Johannesburg's airports: [[OR Tambo International Airport|OR Tambo International]], {{convert|45|km}} south of central Pretoria; and [[Lanseria Airport|Lanseria]], {{convert|35|km}} south-west of the city. [[Wonderboom Airport]] in the suburb of Wonderboom in the north of Pretoria services light commercial and private aircraft. There are two military air bases to the south of the city, [[AFB Swartkop|Swartkop]] and [[AFB Waterkloof|Waterkloof]].  ==Society and Culture==  ===Media=== {{Main|Media in Pretoria}} Since Pretoria forms part the [[Tshwane]] Metropolitan Municipality, most radio, television and paper media is the same as what can be found in the rest of the metro area.  ===Museums=== [[File:Voortrekker Monument.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Voortrekker Monument]]]] [[File:Transvaal Museum Night.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Transvaal Museum]]]]  * [[African Window]] * [[Freedom Park (South Africa)|Freedom Park]] * [[Kruger House (Pretoria)|Kruger House]] (Residence of the president of the ZAR, [[Paul Kruger]]) * [[Mapungubwe Museum]] * [[Melrose House]] (The [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] which ended the [[Anglo-Boer War]] was signed here in 1902) * [[Pretoria Art Museum]] * [[Pretoria Forts]] * [[Transvaal Museum]] * [[Van Tilburg Collection]] * [[Sammy Marks House]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ditsong.org.za/sammymarks.htm |title=: Ditsong Museums Of South Africa : |publisher=Ditsong.org.za |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> * [[Van Wouw Museum]] * [[Voortrekker Monument]]  <gallery> File:Anfiteatro - Freedom Park.jpg|Freedom Park's amphitheatre File:Old merensky.jpg| The [[Eduardo Villa]] collection is housed in the Old [[University of Pretoria Library Services|Merensky Library]], a national monument<ref name=evc>{{cite web |title=Edoardo Villa Collection |url=http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=10323 |publisher=University of Pretoria |accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> File:Culthistory.jpg|African Window File:4 Paul Kruger's House.jpg|Paul Kruger's House File:Melrose house SA.jpg|Melrose House </gallery>  ===Music=== A number of popular South African bands and musicians are originally from Pretoria.

Although the name change was approved by the SAGNC, it has not yet been approved by the Minister of Arts and Culture. The matter is currently under consideration while he has requested further research on the matter. Should the Minister approve the name change, the name will be published in the Government Gazette, giving the public opportunity to comment on the matter. The Minister can then refer that public response back to the SAGNC, before presenting his recommendation before parliament, who will vote on the change. Various public interest groups have warned that the name change will be challenged in court, should the minister approve the renaming. The long process involved made it unlikely the name would change anytime soon, if ever, even assuming the Minister had approved the change in early 2006.  The Tshwane Metro Council has advertised ''Tshwane'' as \"Africa's leading capital city\" since the name change was approved by the SAGNC in 2005. This has led to further controversy, however, as the name of the city had not yet been changed officially, and the council was, at best, acting prematurely. Following a complaint lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), it was ruled that such advertisements are deliberately misleading and should be withdrawn from all media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,9294,2-7-12_2097251,00.html |title=SABC pulls 'Tshwane city' ads |publisher=News24.com |date=11 April 2007 |accessdate=3 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090625212602/http://www.news24.com:80/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,9294,2-7-12_2097251,00.html |archivedate=25 June 2009 }}</ref>  Despite the rulings of the ASA, Tshwane Metro Council failed to discontinue their \"City of Tshwane\" advertisements. As a result, the ASA requested that Tshwane Metro pay for advertisements in which it admits that it has misled the public. Refusing to abide by the ASA's request, the Metro Council was banned consequently from placing any advertisements in the South African media that refer to Tshwane as the capital. ASA may still place additional sanctions on the Metro Council that would prevent it from placing any advertisements in the South African media, including council notices and employment vacancies.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=594&art_id=vn20070423045707464C538603 |title=SA capital advert row sparks ad-alert threat, IOL |publisher=Iol.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/business/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&lvl2=buss&ArticleID=1518-1786_2103974 |title=Media can't place Tshwane ads, FIN24 |publisher=Fin24.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090623161600/http://www.fin24.co.za:80/articles/business/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&lvl2=buss&ArticleID=1518-1786_2103974 |archivedate=23 June 2009 }}</ref>  After the ruling, the Metro Council continued to place ''Tshwane'' advertisements, but placed them on council-owned advertising boards and busstops throughout the municipal area.

A psychiatrist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of [[mental disorder]]s. Psychiatrists are [[medical doctor]]s, unlike [[psychologist]]s, and must evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental, or a strictly psychiatric one. The translation from Greek and Latin origin is as follows: \"Psych\"-Greek transliterated meaning breath, life, soul, spirit or mind; \"Iatro\" is Greek for physician and -ist in Latin comes from \"ista or iste\" and the pronoun means \"that one\" or \"specialist\".  As part of the clinical assessment process they may employ a [[mental status examination]], a [[physical examination]], [[brain imaging]] such as [[computerized tomography]]  (CT/CAT scan), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanning, and [[blood testing]]. Psychiatrists prescribe medicine, and may also use [[psychotherapy]], although the vast majority do medical management and refer to a [[psychologist]] or another specialized therapist for weekly to bi-monthly psychotherapy.  == Subspecialties == The field of psychiatry has many subspecialties (also known as [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] that require additional training which are certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) and require Maintenance of Certification Program (MOC) to continue.

This role can be performed by a team of experts that include mental health specialists (specialists with [[Ph.D]] in [[Neuroscience]] and/or [[Psychology]] ) who can assist the psychiatrist to relay proper recommendations to the primary care team in treatment planning. The psychiatric consultant may suggest treatment modifications for the primary team to consider, recommend or see the patient for an in-person consultation, and consult patients who are clinically challenging or who need specialty mental health services.  == Professional requirements == While requirements to become a psychiatrist differ from country to country, all require a medical degree.<ref name=UKReq>The Royal College of Psychiatrists.

This extended period involves comprehensive training in psychiatric diagnosis, psychopharmacology, medical care issues, and psychotherapies.  All accredited psychiatry residencies in the United States require proficiency in [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]], brief, psychodynamic, and supportive psychotherapies.  Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine or pediatrics, plus a minimum of two months of neurology during their first year of residency, referred to as an \"internship\".<ref name=USReq /> After completing their training, psychiatrists are eligible to take a specialty board examination to become board-certified.<ref name=USReq />  The total amount of time required to complete educational and training requirements in the field of psychiatry in the United States is 12 years after high school. Subspecialists in child and adolescent psychiatry are required to complete a two-year fellowship program, the first year of which can run concurrently with the fourth year of the general psychiatry residency program. This adds one to two years of training.  ===United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland=== In the [[United Kingdom]], psychiatrists must hold a medical degree.<ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerinfoforschoolleavers.aspx Careers info for School leavers]</ref>  These degrees are often abbreviated [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB BChir, MB BCh, MB ChB, BM BS, or MB BS]].  Following this, the individual will work as a [[Foundation House Officer]] for two additional years in the UK, or one year as [[Intern]] in the Republic of Ireland to achieve registration as a basic medical practitioner. Training in psychiatry can then begin and it is taken in two parts: three years of Basic Specialist Training culminating in the MRCPsych exam followed by three years of Higher Specialist Training, referred to as \"ST4-6\" in the UK and \"Senior Registrar Training\" in the Republic of Ireland. Candidates with MRCPsych degree and complete basic training must reinterview for higher specialist training. At this stage, the development of speciality interests such as forensic, child/adolescent take place. At the end of 3 years of higher specialist training, candidates are awarded a CCT (UK) or CCST (Ireland), both meaning Certificate of Completion of (Specialist) Training. At this stage, the psychiatrist can register as a specialist and the qualification of CC(S)T is recognized in all EU/EEA states. As such, training in the UK and Ireland is considerably longer than in the US or Canada and frequently takes around 8–9 years following graduation from medical school. Those with a CC(S)T will be able to apply for Consultant posts. Those with training from outside the EU/EEA should consult local/native medical boards to review their qualifications and eligibility for equivalence recognition (for example, those with a US residency and ABPN qualification).  ===Netherlands=== In the [[Netherlands]] one must complete [[Medical school#Netherlands and Belgium|medical school]] after which one is certified as a medical doctor. After a strict selection program one can specialize in psychiatry: a 4.5 year specialization. During this specialization, the resident has to do a 6-month residency in the field of social psychiatry, a 12-month residency in a field of their own choice (which can be child psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, somatic medicine or medical research).  To become an adolescent psychiatrist, one has to do an extra specialization period of 2 more years. In short this means that it takes at least 10.5 years of study to become a psychiatrist which can go up to 12.5 years if one becomes a children's and adolescent psychiatrist.  == See also == {{columns |width = 22em |col1 = *[[List of famous figures in psychiatry]] *[[List of psychiatrists]] *[[Medicine]] |col2 = *[[Mental health]] *[[Mental health professional]] *[[Mental illness]] |col3 = *[[Psychiatry]] *[[Psychiatric nursing]] *[[Clinical psychology]] *[[Psychologist]] *[[Psychology]] }}  ==References== {{reflist}}  == Further reading == * American Psychiatric Association.

         "In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Peano axioms''', also known as the '''Dedekind–Peano axioms''' or the '''Peano postulates''', are a set of [[axiom]]s for the [[natural number]]s presented by the 19th century [[Italian people|Italian]] [[mathematician]] [[Giuseppe Peano]]. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether [[number theory]] is [[consistency proof|consistent]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]].  The need to formalize [[arithmetic]] was not well appreciated until the work of [[Hermann Grassmann]], who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the [[successor function|successor operation]] and [[mathematical induction|induction]].<ref>Grassmann 1861</ref> In 1881, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] provided an [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatization|axiomatization]] of natural-number arithmetic.<ref>Peirce 1881; also see Shields 1997</ref> In&nbsp;1888, [[Richard Dedekind]] proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in&nbsp;1889 Peano published a more precisely formulated version of them as a collection of axioms in his book, ''The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method'' ({{lang-la|Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita}}).  The Peano axioms contain three types of statements. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set \"number\". The next four are general statements about [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]; in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the Peano axioms, but rather as axioms of the \"underlying logic\".<ref>van Heijenoort 1967:94</ref> The next three axioms are [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final axiom is a [[second-order logic|second order]] statement of the principle of [[mathematical induction]] over the natural numbers. A weaker first-order system called '''Peano arithmetic''' is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the [[Second-order arithmetic#Induction and comprehension schema|second-order induction]] axiom with a first-order [[axiom schema]].  == Formulation ==  When Peano formulated his axioms, the language of [[mathematical logic]] was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and [[logical implication|implication]] (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the [[Begriffsschrift]] by [[Gottlob Frege]], published in 1879.<ref>Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 2</ref> Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of [[George Boole|Boole]] and [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]].<ref>Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 83</ref>  The Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of ''[[natural numbers]]'', usually represented as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''N'' or <math>\\mathbb{N}.</math> The [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] (a formal language's [[non-logical symbol]]s) for the axioms includes a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol ''S''.  The constant 0 is assumed to be a natural number: {{ordered list|start=1 |1= 0 is a natural number. }} The next four axioms describe the [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]. Since they are logically valid in first-order logic with equality, they are not considered to be part of \"the Peano axioms\" in modern treatments.<ref>Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 83</ref> {{ordered list|start=2 |2= For every natural number ''x'', ''x'' = ''x''. That is, equality is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. |3= For all natural numbers ''x'' and ''y'', if ''x'' = ''y'', then ''y'' = ''x''. That is, equality is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]. |4= For all natural numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'', if ''x'' = ''y'' and ''y'' = ''z'', then ''x'' = ''z''. That is, equality is [[transitive relation|transitive]]. |5= For all ''a'' and ''b'', if ''b'' is a natural number and ''a'' = ''b'', then ''a'' is also a natural number. That is, the natural numbers are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under equality. }} The remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued \"[[successor function|successor]]\" [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''S''. {{ordered list|start=6 |6=For every natural number ''n'', ''S''(''n'') is a natural number. }} Peano's original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the \"first\" natural number.<ref>Peano 1889, p. 1</ref> This choice is arbitrary, as axiom 1 does not endow the constant 0 with any additional properties. However, because{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  0 is the [[identity element|additive identity]] in arithmetic, most modern formulations of the Peano axioms start from 0. Axioms 1 and 6 define a [[unary numeral system|unary]] representation of the natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as ''S''(0), 2 as ''S''(''S''(0)) (which is also ''S''(1)), and, in general, any natural number ''n'' as the result of ''n''-fold application of ''S'' to 0, denoted as ''S''<sup>''n''</sup>(0). The next two axioms define the properties of this representation. {{ordered list|start=7 |7=For all natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', ''m'' = ''n'' if and only if ''S''(''m'') = ''S''(''n''). That is, ''S'' is an [[injective function|injection]]. |8=For every natural number ''n'', ''S''(''n'') = 0 is false. That is, there is no natural number whose successor is 0. }}  [[File:Domino effect visualizing exclusion of junk term by induction axiom.jpg|thumb|The set of natural numbers can be illustrated by the infinite chain of light brown domino pieces, with the nearest piece corresponding to 0. However, the Peano axioms 1–8 are also satisfied by the set of all pieces present, both light and dark <ref>Note: The non-contiguous set satisfies axiom 1 as it has a 0 element, 2-5 as it doesn't affect equality relations, 6 & 8 as all pieces have a successor, bar the zero element and axiom 7 as no two dominos topple, or are toppled by, the same piece.</ref>{{OR?|date=September 2015}}. The induction axiom, 9, corresponds to the requirement that if the first light brown domino piece is overthrown, then all pieces of the set will eventually fall (\"[[domino effect]]\"); it is only satisfied if the entire set of considered pieces forms a chain.<ref>Note: Though the ring of dark pieces would itself satisfy axiom 9, it wouldn't satisfy axiom 8, as its zero element would have a predecessor.</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}]]  Axioms 1, 6, 7 and 8 imply that the set of natural numbers contains the distinct elements 0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), and furthermore that {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …} ⊆ ''N''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This shows that the set of natural numbers is infinite. However, to show that ''N'' = {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …}, it must be shown that ''N'' ⊆ {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …}; i.e., it must be shown that every natural number is included in {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …}. To do this however requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the ''axiom of induction''. This axiom provides a method for reasoning about the set of all natural numbers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  {{ordered list|start=9 |9=If ''K'' is a set such that: * ''0'' is in ''K'', and * for every natural number ''n'', if ''n'' is in ''K'', then ''S''(''n'') is in ''K'', then ''K'' contains every natural number. }}  The induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form: {{ordered list|start=9 |9=If φ is a unary [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] such that: * φ(0) is true, and * for every natural number ''n'', if φ(''n'') is true, then φ(''S''(''n'')) is true, then φ(''n'') is true for every natural number ''n''. }}  In Peano's original formulation, the induction axiom is a [[second-order logic|second-order axiom]]. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker [[first-order logic|first-order]] induction scheme.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section [[#Models|Models]] below.  == Arithmetic == The Peano axioms can be augmented with the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] and the usual [[total order|total (linear) ordering]] on [[natural numbers#Notation|''N'']]. The respective functions and relations are constructed in [[second-order logic]], and are shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.  === Addition === [[Addition in N|Addition]] is a function that [[map (mathematics)|maps]] two natural numbers (two elements of ''N'') to another one. It is defined [[recursion|recursively]] as: :<math>\\begin{align} a + 0       &= a ,\\\\ a + S (b) &= S (a + b). \\end{align}</math> For example, :''a'' + 1 = ''a'' + ''S''(0) = ''S''(''a'' + 0) = ''S''(''a''). The [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (''N'', +) is a [[commutative]] [[semigroup]] with identity element 0. (''N'', +) is also a [[cancellation property|cancellative]] [[magma (algebra)|magma]], and thus [[embedding|embeddable]] in a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The smallest group embedding ''N'' is the [[integer]]s.  === Multiplication === Similarly, [[multiplication]] is a function mapping two natural numbers to another one. Given addition, it is defined recursively as: :<math>\\begin{align} a \\cdot 0 &= 0, \\\\ a \\cdot S (b) &= a + (a \\cdot b). \\end{align}</math> It is easy to see that setting b equal to    0<!---don't change to 1: S(b) is the multiplicative identity below, not just b--->    yields the multiplicative [[identity element|identity]]: :''a'' · 1 = ''a'' · ''S''(0) = ''a'' + (''a'' · 0) = ''a'' + 0 = ''a'' Moreover, multiplication [[distributive law|distributes over]] addition: :''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c''). Thus, (''N'', +, 0, ·, 1) is a commutative [[semiring]].  === Inequalities === The usual [[total order]] relation ≤ on natural numbers can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number: :For all ''a'', ''b'' ∈ ''N'', ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if there exists some ''c'' ∈ ''N'' such that ''a'' + ''c'' = ''b''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for <math> a, b, c \\in N </math>, if ''a'' ≤ ''b'', then: * ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c'', and * ''a'' · ''c'' ≤ ''b'' · ''c''. Thus, the structure (''N'', +, ·, 1, 0, ≤) is an [[ordered ring|ordered semiring]]; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring.  The axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following ''strong'' form, making use of the ≤ order:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} :For any [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] φ, if :* φ(0) is true, and :* for every ''n'', ''k'' ∈ ''N'', if ''k'' ≤ ''n'' implies ''φ''(''k'') is true, then φ(''S''(''n'')) is true, :then for every ''n'' ∈ ''N'', φ(''n'') is true. This form of the induction axiom is a simple consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} for reasoning about the ≤ order. For example, to show that the naturals are [[well-order]]ed—every [[empty set|nonempty]] [[subset]] of ''N'' has a [[least element]]—one can reason as follows.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Let a nonempty ''X'' ⊆ ''N'' be given and assume ''X'' has no least element. * Because 0 is the least element of ''N'', it must be that 0 ∉ ''X''. * For any ''n'' ∈ ''N'', suppose for every ''k'' ≤ ''n'', ''k'' ∉ ''X''. Then ''S''(''n'') ∉ ''X'', for otherwise it would be the least element of ''X''. Thus, by the strong induction principle, for every ''n'' ∈ ''N'', ''n'' ∉ ''X''. Thus, ''X'' ∩ ''N'' = ∅, which [[contradiction|contradicts]] ''X'' being a nonempty subset of ''N''. Thus ''X'' has a least element.  == First-order theory of arithmetic == All of the Peano axioms except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in [[first-order logic]].<ref>Partee ''et al.'' 2012:215</ref> The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is [[second-order logic|second-order]], since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), but it can be transformed into a first-order ''[[axiom schema]]'' of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.<ref>Harsanyi 1983.</ref>  First-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have an important limitation, however. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the [[successor function|successor operation]], but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.  The following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality), which contains six of the seven axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]], is sufficient for this purpose:<ref>Mendelson 1997:155</ref> * ∀''x''∈''N''. 0 ≠ ''S''(''x'') * ∀''x'',''y''∈''N''. ''S''(''x'') = ''S''(''y'') ⇒ ''x'' = ''y'' * ∀''x''∈''N''. ''x'' + 0 = ''x'' * ∀''x'',''y''∈''N''. ''x'' + ''S''(''y'') = ''S''(''x'' + ''y'') * ∀''x''∈''N''. ''x'' ⋅ 0 = 0 * ∀''x'',''y''∈''N''. ''x'' ⋅ ''S''(''y'') = ''x'' ⋅ ''y'' + ''x''  In addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a [[Countable set|countably infinite]] set of [[axioms]]. For each formula φ(''x'',''y''<sub>1</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>) in the language of Peano arithmetic, the '''first-order induction axiom''' for φ is the sentence :<math>\\forall \\bar{y} (\\varphi(0,\\bar{y}) \\land \\forall x ( \\varphi(x,\\bar{y})\\Rightarrow\\varphi(S(x),\\bar{y})) \\Rightarrow \\forall x \\varphi(x,\\bar{y}))</math> where <math>\\bar{y}</math> is an abbreviation for ''y''<sub>1</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>. The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom, that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula φ.  === Equivalent axiomatizations === There are many different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, such as the one just described, use a signature that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of [[ordered ring|ordered semirings]], including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.<ref>Kaye 1991, pp. 16–18</ref>  <!-- These axioms are taken directly from Kaye 1991. Please don't \"tweak\" them, add additional axioms, or remove axioms without discussion on the talk page. --> # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)</math>, i.e., addition is [[associative law|associative]]. # <math>\\forall x, y \\in N</math>. <math>x + y = y + x</math>, i.e., addition is [[commutative law|commutative]]. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot (y \\cdot z)</math>, i.e., multiplication is associative. # <math>\\forall x, y \\in N</math>. <math>x \\cdot y = y \\cdot x</math>, i.e., multiplication is commutative. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>x \\cdot (y + z) = (x \\cdot y) + (x \\cdot z)</math>, i.e., the [[distributive law]]. # <math>\\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>x + 0 = x \\and x \\cdot 0 = 0</math>, i.e., zero is the identity element for addition. # <math>\\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>x \\cdot 1 = x</math>, i.e., one is the identity element for multiplication. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>x < y \\and y < z \\Rightarrow x < z</math>, i.e., the '&lt;' operator is [[Transitive relation|transitive]]. # <math>\\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>\\neg (x < x)</math>, i.e., the '&lt;' operator is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]]. # <math>\\forall x, y \\in N</math>. <math>x < y \\or x = y \\or y < x</math>. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>x < y \\Rightarrow x + z < y + z</math>. # <math>\\forall x, y, z \\in N</math>. <math>0 < z \\and x < y \\Rightarrow x \\cdot z < y \\cdot z</math>. # <math>\\forall x, y \\in N x < y \\Rightarrow \\exists z \\in N x + z = y</math>. # <math>0 < 1 \\and \\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>x > 0 \\Rightarrow x \\geq 1</math>. # <math>\\forall x \\in N</math>. <math>x \\geq 0</math>. The theory defined by these axioms is known as '''PA<sup>−</sup>'''; PA is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema.  An important property of PA<sup>−</sup> is that any structure ''M'' satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by ≤) isomorphic to ''N''. Elements of ''M'' \\ ''N'' are known as '''nonstandard''' elements.  == Models == A [[model theory|model]] of the Peano axioms is a triple (''N'', 0, ''S''), where ''N'' is a (necessarily infinite) set, 0 ∈ ''N'' and ''S'' : ''N'' → ''N'' satisfies the axioms above. [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] proved in his 1888 book, ''What are numbers and what should they be'' ({{lang-de|Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen}}) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. In particular, given two models (''N''<sub>''A''</sub>, 0<sub>''A''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''A''</sub>) and (''N''<sub>''B''</sub>, 0<sub>''B''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''B''</sub>) of the Peano axioms, there is a unique [[homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''N''<sub>''A''</sub> → ''N''<sub>''B''</sub> satisfying :<math>\\begin{align} f(0_A) &= 0_B \\\\ f(S_A (n)) &= S_B (f (n)) \\end{align}</math> and it is a [[bijective function|bijection]]. This means that second-order Peano axioms are [[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]]. This is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, however.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  === Nonstandard models === Although the usual [[natural number]]s satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other '''[[non-standard model]]s''' as well; the [[compactness theorem]] implies{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.  When interpreted as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.  It is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. The answer is affirmative as [[Skolem]] in 1933 provided an explicit  construction of such a nonstandard model.  On the other hand, [[Tennenbaum's theorem]], proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is [[computable function|computable]].<ref>Kaye 1991, sec. 11.3</ref> This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. However, there is only one possible [[order type]] of a countable nonstandard model. Letting ω be the order type of the natural numbers, ζ be the order type of the integers, and η be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is ω + ζ·η, which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.  === Set-theoretic models === {{Main|Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers}} The Peano axioms can be derived from [[set theory|set theoretic]] constructions of the [[natural number]]s and axioms of set theory such as the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]].<ref>Suppes 1960; Hatcher 1982</ref> The standard construction of the naturals, due to [[John von Neumann]], starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, ∅, and an operator ''s'' on sets defined as: :''s''(''a'') = ''a'' ∪ { ''a'' }. The set of natural numbers '''N''' is defined as the intersection of all sets [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under ''s'' that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it: :<math>\\begin{align} 0 &= \\emptyset \\\\ 1 &= s(0) = s(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset \\cup \\{ \\emptyset \\} = \\{ \\emptyset \\} = \\{ 0 \\} \\\\ 2 &= s(1) = s(\\{ 0 \\}) = \\{ 0 \\} \\cup \\{ \\{ 0 \\} \\} = \\{ 0 , \\{ 0 \\} \\} = \\{ 0, 1 \\} \\\\ 3 &= ... = \\{ 0, 1, 2 \\} \\end{align}</math> and so on. The set '''N''' together with 0 and the [[successor function]] ''s'' : '''N''' → '''N''' satisfies the Peano axioms. <!-- dubious: The induction axiom is proven using the [[axiom of infinity]] of set theory.-->  Peano arithmetic is [[equiconsistent]] with several weak systems of set theory.<ref>Tarski &amp; Givant 1987, sec. 7.6</ref> One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of [[general set theory]] ([[extensionality]], existence of the [[empty set]], and the [[general set theory|axiom of adjunction]]), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.  === Interpretation in category theory === The Peano axioms can also be understood using [[category theory]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Let ''C'' be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with [[terminal object]] 1<sub>''C''</sub>, and define the category of '''pointed unary systems''', US<sub>1</sub>(''C'') as follows: * The objects of US<sub>1</sub>(''C'') are triples (''X'', 0<sub>''X''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>) where ''X'' is an object of ''C'', and 0<sub>''X''</sub> : 1<sub>''C''</sub> → ''X'' and ''S''<sub>''X''</sub> : ''X'' → ''X'' are ''C''-morphisms. * A morphism φ : (''X'', 0<sub>''X''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>) → (''Y'', 0<sub>''Y''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''Y''</sub>) is a ''C''-morphism φ : ''X'' → ''Y'' with φ 0<sub>''X''</sub> = 0<sub>''Y''</sub> and φ ''S''<sub>''X''</sub> = ''S''<sub>''Y''</sub> φ. Then ''C'' is said to satisfy the Dedekind–Peano axioms if US<sub>1</sub>(''C'') has an initial object; this initial object is known as a [[natural number object]] in ''C''. If (''N'', 0, ''S'') is this initial object, and (''X'', 0<sub>''X''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>) is any other object, then the unique map ''u'' : (''N'', 0, ''S'') → (''X'', 0<sub>''X''</sub>, ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>) is such that :<math>\\begin{align} u 0 &= 0_X, \\\\ u (S x) &= S_X (u x). \\end{align}</math> This is precisely the recursive definition of 0<sub>''X''</sub> and ''S''<sub>''X''</sub>.  == Consistency ==  {{Main|Hilbert's second problem}}  When the Peano axioms were first proposed, [[Bertrand Russell]] and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a \"natural number\". [[Henri Poincaré]] was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were ''consistent''; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything. In 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed the problem of proving their consistency using only [[Finitism|finitistic]] methods as the [[Hilbert's second problem|second]] of his [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three problems]].<ref>Hilbert 1900</ref> In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] proved his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]], which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.<ref>Godel 1931</ref>  Although it is widely claimed that Gödel's theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. Gödel himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958 Gödel published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using [[type theory]].<ref>Godel 1958</ref> In 1936, [[Gerhard Gentzen]] gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using [[transfinite induction]] up to an ordinal called [[epsilon zero|ε<sub>0</sub>]].<ref>Gentzen 1936</ref> Gentzen explained: \"The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles\". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε<sub>0</sub> can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a [[Turing machine]] describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.  The vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano's axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as [[Gentzen's consistency proof|Gentzen's proof]]. The small number of mathematicians who advocate [[ultrafinitism]] reject Peano's axioms because the axioms require an infinite set of natural numbers.  ==See also== * [[Foundations of mathematics]] * [[Gentzen's consistency proof]] * [[Goodstein's theorem]] * [[Paris–Harrington theorem]] * [[Presburger arithmetic]] * [[Robinson arithmetic]] * [[Second-order arithmetic]] * [[Non-standard model of arithmetic]] * [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]] * [[Frege's theorem]]  == Footnotes == {{reflist|2}}  == References == * [[Martin Davis]], 1974.

To the naked eye, it appears to be a single star, the [[list of brightest stars|eighth brightest]] in the night sky with a visual [[apparent magnitude]] of 0.34.<ref name=aaa413/> It is classified as a [[binary star]] system, consisting of a white [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star of [[spectral type]] F5&nbsp;IV–V, named '''Procyon&nbsp;A''', and a faint [[white dwarf]] companion of spectral type DQZ,<ref name=Provencal2002/> named '''Procyon&nbsp;B'''.  The reason for its brightness is not its intrinsic luminosity but its relative closeness to the [[Sun]].  As determined by the [[European Space Agency]] [[Hipparcos]] astrometry satellite,<ref name=aaa323_L49/><ref name=GSM/> it lies at a distance of just {{Convert|11.46|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}},<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> and is therefore one of our [[List of nearest stars|nearest stellar neighbours]]. Its closest neighboring star is [[Luyten's Star]], about {{Convert|1.12|ly|pc|abbr=on|lk=off}} away, and the latter would appear as a visual magnitude 2.7 star in the night sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Procyon.<ref name=Annot/>  ==Visibility== Procyon is the eighth brightest star in the night sky, [[Culmination|culminating]] at midnight on January 14.<ref name=\"Schaaf2008\"/> It forms one of the three [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the [[Winter Triangle]] [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], in combination with [[Sirius]] and [[Betelgeuse]].{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=166}} The prime period for evening viewing of Procyon is in late winter.<ref name=\"Schaaf2008\"/>  It has a [[color index]] is 0.42, and its hue has been described as having a faint yellow tinge to it.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=166}}  ==System== Procyon is a [[binary star]] system with a bright primary component, Procyon A, having an apparent magnitude of 0.34,<ref name=aaa413/> and a faint companion, Procyon B, at magnitude 10.7.<ref name=\"ApJ119_2\"/> The pair orbit each other with a [[orbital period|period]] of 40.82&nbsp;years along an elliptical orbit with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.407. The [[orbital plane|plane]] of their orbit is inclined at an angle of 31.1° to the line of sight with the Earth.<ref name=aj119_5/> The average separation of the two components is 15.0 [[astronomical unit|AU]]s, a little less than the distance between [[Uranus]] and the Sun, though the eccentric orbit carries them as close as 8.9&nbsp;AUs and as far as 21.0&nbsp;AU.<ref name=Kaler2011/>  ===Primary star=== The primary has a [[stellar classification]] of F5IV–V, indicating that it is a late-stage [[F-type main-sequence star]]. Procyon A is bright for its spectral class, suggesting that it is evolving into a ''[[subgiant]]'' that has nearly [[nuclear fusion|fused]] its core [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]], after which it will expand as \"burning\" moves outside the core.<ref name=aaa413/> As it continues to expand, the star will eventually swell to about 80 to 150 times its current diameter and become a red or orange color. This will probably happen within 10 to 100 million years.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=168}}  The [[effective temperature]] of the [[stellar atmosphere]] is an estimated 6,530&nbsp;K,<ref name=aaa413/> giving Procyon A a white hue. It is 1.5 times the [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}), twice the [[solar radius]] ({{Solar radius|link=y}}), and has 6.9 times the [[solar luminosity|Sun's luminosity]] ({{Solar luminosity|link=y}}).<ref name=aaa413/><ref name=aj131/> Both the core and the envelope of this star are [[Convection zone|convective]]; the two regions being separated by a wide [[radiation zone]].<ref name=Liebert2013/>  ====Oscillations==== In late June 2004, [[Canada]]'s orbital [[MOST satellite telescope]] carried out a 32-day survey of Procyon&nbsp;A. The continuous optical monitoring was intended to confirm [[solar-like oscillations]] in its brightness observed from Earth and to permit [[asteroseismology]]. No [[oscillations]] were detected and the authors concluded that the theory of stellar oscillations may need to be reconsidered.<ref name=nature430_921/> However, others argued that the non-detection was consistent with published ground-based [[radial velocity]] observations of [[solar-like oscillations]].<ref name=nature432_7015/><ref name=aaa432/>  [[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometric]] measurements from the [[NASA]] [[Wide Field Infrared Explorer]] (WIRE) satellite from 1999 and 2000 showed evidence of granulation ([[convection]] near the surface of the [[star]]) and [[solar-like oscillations]].<ref name=apj633/> Unlike the MOST result, the variation seen in the WIRE photometry was in agreement with [[radial velocity]] measurements from the ground. <gallery> File:Procyonorbitillustration.jpg|Procyon orbit </gallery>  ===White dwarf companion=== Like Sirius B, Procyon's companion is a [[white dwarf]] that was inferred from [[astrometry|astrometric]] data long before it was observed. Its existence had been postulated by [[Friedrich Bessel]] as early as 1844, and, although its orbital elements had been calculated by [[Arthur Auwers]] in 1862 as part of his thesis,<ref name=auwers/> Procyon&nbsp;B was not visually confirmed until 1896 when [[John Martin Schaeberle]] observed it at the predicted position using the 36-inch refractor at [[Lick Observatory]].<ref name=burnham78/> It is more difficult to observe from Earth than Sirius&nbsp;B, due to a greater [[apparent magnitude]] difference and smaller angular separation from its primary.<ref name=Kaler2011/>  At {{Solar mass|0.6|link=y}}, Procyon&nbsp;B is considerably less massive than Sirius&nbsp;B; however, the peculiarities of [[degenerate matter]] ensure that it is larger than its more famous neighbor, with an estimated radius of 8,600 [[kilometer|km]], versus 5,800&nbsp;km for Sirius&nbsp;B.<ref name=\"Provencal2002\" /><ref name=apj497/> The radius agrees with white dwarf models that assume a carbon core.<ref name=\"Provencal2002\" /> It has a [[stellar classification]] of DQZ,<ref name=Provencal2002/> having a helium-dominated atmosphere with traces of heavy elements. For reasons that remain unclear, the mass of Procyon&nbsp;B is unusually low for a white dwarf star of its type.<ref name=Liebert2013/> With a surface temperature of 7,740&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], it is also much cooler than Sirius&nbsp;B; this is a testament to its lesser mass and greater age. The mass of the progenitor star for Procyon B was about {{val|2.59|+0.22|-0.18|u=solar mass}} and it came to the end of its life some {{val|1.19|0.11}}&nbsp;Gyr ago, after a main-sequence lifetime of {{val|680|170}}&nbsp;Myr.<ref name=Liebert2013/>  ===X-ray emission=== Attempts to detect X-ray emission from Procyon with nonimaging, [[soft X-ray]]–sensitive detectors prior to 1975 failed.<ref name=apj202/><ref name=apj202/> Extensive observations of Procyon were carried out with the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory#OAO-3 (Copernicus)|Copernicus]] and [[TD-1A]] satellites in the late 1970s.<ref name=apj228_1/> The X-ray source associated with Procyon A/B was observed on April&nbsp;1, 1979, with the [[Einstein Observatory]] high-resolution imager (HRI).<ref name=apj540/> The HRI X-ray pointlike source location is ~4\" south of Procyon A, on the edge of the 90% confidence error circle, indicating identification with Procyon A rather than Procyon B which was located about 5\" north of Procyon&nbsp;A (about 9\" from the X-ray source location).<ref name=apj228_1/>  ===Possibility of life=== Life is unlikely around Procyon, because the habitable zone around 2.7&nbsp;AU from the primary may not contain stable orbits, due to the white dwarf companion with a [[periastron]] of 8.9 AU.{{or|date=July 2015}} Also the white dwarf companion to Procyon would have stressed life severely during its [[red-giant]] phase. Procyon emits more of its light in the [[ultraviolet]] spectrum, which may be damaging to life. Still, life cannot be ruled out for other stars of the spectral type of Procyon, but such life would have a relatively short time to evolve and would face heavy bombardment from [[comet]]s and [[meteorite]]s as happened in the first few million years of the [[Earth]]’s existence. Shortly after the phase of heavy bombardment has ended for a planet orbiting a star like Procyon the star is likely to leave the [[main sequence]] preventing further development of life.<ref name=exoplaneten/>  ==Etymology and cultural significance== Its name comes from the ancient Greek {{lang|grc|Προκύων}} (''{{transl|grc|Prokyon}}''), meaning \"before the dog\", since it precedes the \"Dog Star\" [[Sirius]] as it travels across the sky due to [[Earth]]'s rotation. (Although Procyon has a greater [[right ascension]], it also has a more northerly [[declination]], which means it will rise above the [[horizon]] earlier than Sirius from most northerly latitudes.) In Greek mythology, Procyon is associated with [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], a hound belonging to [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]], daughter of [[Icarius of Athens]].<ref name=mw1999/>  These two dog stars are referred to in the most ancient literature and were venerated by the [[Babylon]]ians and the [[Egypt]]ians, In Babylonian mythology, Procyon was known as Nangar the Carpenter, an aspect of [[Marduk]], involved in constructing and organising the celestial sky.<ref name=\"kelley11\">{{cite book|author=Kelley, David H.|author2=Milone, Eugene F.|author3=Aveni, A.F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|publisher=Springer|location=New York, New York|date=2011|pages=217|isbn=144197623X|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC&pg=PA217&dq=Procyon+Nangar&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1ebkT-2BN8fsmAW34riUCw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Procyon%20Nangar&f=false}}</ref>  The constellations in [[Slavic Macedonians|Macedonian]] folklore represented agricultural items and animals, reflecting their village way of life.

Typically, little distinction was made between enemy combatants and enemy civilians, although women and children were more likely to be spared. Sometimes, the purpose of a battle, if not a war, was to capture women, a practice known as ''[[raptio]]''; the [[Rape of the Sabines]] was a large mass abduction by the founders of Rome. Typically women had no [[women's rights|rights]], and were held legally as [[chattel]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  In the fourth century AD, the Bishop [[Acacius of Amida]], touched by the plight of Persian prisoners captured in a recent war with the Roman Empire—who were held in his town under appalling conditions and destined for a life of slavery, took the initiative of ransoming them, by selling his church's precious gold and silver vessels, and letting them return to their country.

If he swore not to escape, he could gain better accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities against the nation who held him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity.  ===European Settlers Captured in North America=== {{further|American Revolution prisoners of war}} Early historical narratives of captured colonial Europeans, including perspectives of literate women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, exist in some number. The writings of [[Mary Rowlandson]] captured in the brutal fighting of [[King Philip's War]] are an example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the [[captivity narrative]], and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[Last of the Mohicans]]''. Some Native Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as laborers and bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast from 1802–1805.  ===French Revolutionary wars and Napoleonic wars=== The earliest known purposely built [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was established at [[Norman Cross]], England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of [[privateers]]. About 100 senior officers and some civilians \"of good social standing\", mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given ''parole d'honneur'' outside the prison, mainly in [[Peterborough]] although some as far away as [[Northampton]], [[Plymouth]], [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] and [[Abergavenny]]. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society.  ===Prisoner exchanges=== The extensive period of conflict during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1793–1815), followed by the [[United Kingdom – United States relations|Anglo-American]] [[War of 1812]], led to the emergence of a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] system for the [[exchange of prisoners]], even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.  ===American Civil War=== {{main|American Civil War prison camps}} At the start of the civil war a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held in camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed to perform any military duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger Pickenpaugh|title=Captives in Blue: The Civil War Prisons of the Confederacy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pWOfsOceCNUC&pg=PA57|year=2013|publisher=University of Alabama Press|pages=57–73}}</ref> The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. In the late summer of 1864, a year after the Dix-Hill Cartel was suspended; Confederate officials approached Union General Benjamin Butler, Union Commissioner of Exchange, about resuming the cartel and including the black prisoners. Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to Butler on August 18, 1864 with his now famous statement. He rejected the offer, stating in essence, that the Union could afford to leave their men in captivity, the Confederacy could not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ande/historyculture/grant-and-the-prisoner-exchange.htm |title=Myth: General Ulysses S.

National Geographic News. 1 July 2003.</ref>  ===Amelioration=== During the 19th century, there were increased efforts to improve the treatment and processing of prisoners. As a result of these emerging conventions, a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new [[treaty|conventions]] being adopted and becoming recognized as [[international law]] that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.  ===Hague and Geneva Conventions=== Specifically, Chapter II of the Annex to the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land'' covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further expanded in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War]] and were largely revised in the [[Third Geneva Convention]] in 1949.  Article 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] protects captured [[military personnel]], some [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters, and certain [[civilians]]. It applies from the moment a prisoner is captured until he or she is released or repatriated. One of the main provisions of the convention makes it illegal to [[torture]] prisoners and states that a prisoner can only be required to give their [[name]], [[date of birth]], [[Military rank|rank]] and [[service number]] (if applicable).  The [[ICRC]] has a special role to play, with regards to [[international humanitarian law]], in [[Restoring Family Links|restoring and maintaining family contact in times of war]], in particular concerning the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art.71 and GC IV, art.107).  However, nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, [[Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labor. The Germans also routinely executed Western Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the [[Commando Order]]. North Korean and North and South Vietnamese forces<ref name=\"south-viet\">{{cite web|title=In South Vietnamese Jails|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10775|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those conflicts.  ====Qualifications==== [[File:Japanese Beheading 1894.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese illustration depicting the beheading of Chinese captives. [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–5.]] To be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be lawful combatants entitled to combatant's privilege—which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing enemy combatants. To qualify under the Third Geneva Convention, a combatant must be part of a [[chain of command]], wear a \"fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance\", bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the [[laws and customs of war]]. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as \"[i]nhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".)  Thus, uniforms and/or badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status; and ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', [[terrorists]], [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], and [[Espionage|spies]] do not qualify because they do not always follow the laws and customs of war and therefore they fall under the category of [[unlawful combatants]]. In practice, these criteria are rarely interpreted strictly. [[Guerrilla]]s, for example, usually do not wear a uniform or carry arms openly, but captured guerrillas are often granted POW status.  The criteria are applied primarily to ''international'' armed conflicts; in [[civil wars]], [[insurgents]] are often treated as [[traitors]] or [[criminals]] by government forces, and are sometimes executed. However, in the [[American Civil War]], both sides treated captured troops as POWs, presumably out of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], although the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regarded [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.  ===Rights=== Under the Third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war (POW) must be:  *Treated humanely with respect for their persons and their honor *Able to inform their next of kin and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] of their capture *Allowed to communicate regularly with relatives and receive packages *Given adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical attention *Paid for work done and not forced to do work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or degrading *Released quickly after conflicts end *Not compelled to give any information except for name, age, rank, and service number<ref>{{cite web|title=Geneva Convention|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_geneva_con.html|publisher=Peace Pledge Union|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>  In addition, if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Story of an idea- the Film|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwB-Y6FUjY|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>  When a country is responsible for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished accordingly. An example of this is the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Trials]]. German and Japanese military commanders were prosecuted for preparing and initiating a [[war of aggression]], [[murder]], ill treatment, and [[deportation]] of individuals, and [[genocide]] during World War II.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penrose|first=Mary Margaret|title=War Crime|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635621/war-crime/224687/The-Nurnberg-and-Tokyo-trials|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> Most were executed or sentenced to life in prison for their crimes.  ===The United States Military Terminology and Code of Conduct=== [[File:VietnamCombatArtCATJamesPollockWaitingInterrogation.jpg|thumb|right|''Waiting interrogation, 199th LT INF BG'' by [[James Pollock (artist)|James Pollock]], [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Vietnam Combat Artists Program]] Team IV, (CAT IV 1967).

Eisenhower]] to serve as a moral code for United States service members who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organization, specifically when U.S. forces were POWs during the [[Korean War]].  When a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, \"name, rank, serial number\"), receiving special favors or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.  Since the [[Vietnam War]], the official U.S. military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name change was introduced in order to distinguish between enemy and U.S. captives.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-40/ch1.htm#par2 |title=FM3-19.40 Part 1 Fundamentals of Internment/Resettlement Operations Chptr 1 Introduction |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=12 August 1949 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE1239F93AA25751C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=WAR IN THE GULF: P.O.W.'s; U.S. Says Prisoners Seem War-Weary | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=19 February 1991}}</ref>  In 2000, the U.S. military replaced the designation \"Prisoner of War\" with \"Missing-Captured\".

Bellot, \"Treatment of Prisoners of War\", ''Transactions of the Grotius Society'', Vol. 5, (1919), pp. 47–64.</ref> Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3 million men became prisoners.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.'' (1999) pp. 368–69 for data.</ref>  The [[German Empire]] held 2.5 million prisoners; [[Russian Empire|Russia]] held 2.9 million, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] held about 720,000, mostly gained in the period just before the [[Armistice]] in 1918. The US held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes shot down. Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations.  There was however much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador to Germany (prior to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in \"My Four Years in Germany\". Even worse conditions are reported in the book \"Escape of a Princess Pat\" by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2 million POWs held there died.<ref>\"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=PP7uMQdgv5AC&pg=PA240&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Disobedience and Conspiracy in the German Army, 1918–1945]''\".

The first British prisoners were released and reached [[Calais]] on 15 November. Plans were made for them to be sent via [[Dunkirk]] to [[Dover]] and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for [[demobilisation]].  On 13 December 1918 the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released ''en masse'' and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many released prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by [[cavalry]] troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.

The International Red Cross could do nothing for them, as they were not regarded as POW's, but the prisoners held the status of \"Military Internees\". Treatment of the prisoners was generally poor. The author Giovanni Guareschi was among those interned and wrote about this time in his life. The book was translated and published as \"My Secret Diary\". He wrote about the hungers of semi-starvation, the casual murder of individual prisoners by guards and how when they were released (now in a German camp) they found a deserted German town, filled with foodstuffs that they (with other released prisoners) ate.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}  ====Cossacks====  On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the United States and the United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation – The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=17 January 2012 }}</ref> The interpretation of this Agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets ([[Operation Keelhaul]]) regardless of their wishes.

The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a ''person'', it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps [[security]] ([[confidentiality]]), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [[bodily integrity]].  The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the [[government]], [[corporation]]s or [[individual]]s is part of many countries' [[#Privacy law|privacy laws]], and in some cases, [[constitution]]s. Almost all countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning [[taxation]], which normally require the sharing of information about personal [[income]] or [[earnings]]. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with [[freedom of speech]] laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures.  Privacy may be [[Communication privacy management theory|voluntarily sacrificed]], normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used.<ref name=\"transparency\">{{cite journal|last=Oulasvirta |first=Antti |last2=Suomalainen |first2=Tiia |last3=Hamari |first3=Juho |last4=Lampinen |first4=Airi |last5=Karvonen |first5=Kristiina |date=2014 |title=Transparency of Intentions Decreases Privacy Concerns in Ubiquitous Surveillance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264638054_Transparency_of_Intentions_Decreases_Privacy_Concerns_in_Ubiquitous_Surveillance |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=633–638 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0585}}</ref> In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for [[advertising]] purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize.

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with [[Western culture]], British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zemskaya|first=E.

The distinction or overlap between [[secrecy]] and privacy is [[ontology|ontologically]] subtle, which is why the word \"privacy\" is an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] [[lexeme]],<ref name=\"TranslationToday\"/> and many languages do not have a specific word for \"privacy\". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of ''уединение''—solitude, ''секретность''—secrecy, and ''частная жизнь''—private life) or borrow from English \"privacy\" (as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''Privasi'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''la privacy'').<ref name=\"TranslationToday\">{{cite book|title=Translation Today: Trends and Perspectives |last=Anderman |first=Gunilla M. |author2=Rogers, Margaret |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hJxVffwZEDgC&lpg=PA73&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q=privacy&f=false |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> The distinction hinges on the [[discrete]]ness of [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]] of parties (persons or groups), which can have [[emic and etic|emic]] variation depending on cultural mores of [[individualism]], [[collectivism]], and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]]. The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as \"when ''I'' withhold information, it is privacy; when ''you'' withhold information, it is secrecy.\"  ==Types of privacy== A broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=12-13}} One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=12-13}}  #The right to be let alone #the option to limit the access others have to one's personal information #[[secrecy]], or the option to conceal any information from others #control over others' use of information about oneself #the idea of [[personhood]] #protection of [[intimate relationships]]  ===Right to be let alone=== In 1890 the United States [[jurists]] [[Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]] wrote ''[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]'', an article in which they argued for the “right to be let alone”, using that phrase as a definition of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=15-17}} There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being “let alone”, and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose [[seclusion]] from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one’s own home.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=15-17}} Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=15-17}}  ===Limited access=== Limited access refers to a person’s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}  Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one’s personal information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}} [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] wrote in the late 19th century that “nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Godkin|first1=E.L.|authorlink1=Edwin Lawrence Godkin|title=Libel and its Legal Remedy|journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]]|date=December 1880|volume=46|issue=278|pages=729–739|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0046-6;didno=atla0046-6;view=image;seq=0735;node=atla0046-6%3A1}}</ref> Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison 9 years earlier,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gavison|first1=Ruth|authorlink1=Ruth Gavison|title=Privacy and the Limits of Law|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1980|pages=421–471}}</ref> [[Sissela Bok]] said that privacy is “the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others- either physical access, personal information, or attention.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bok|first1=Sissela|authorlink1=Sissela Bok|title=Secrets : on the ethics of concealment and revelation|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679724735|pages=10–11|edition=Vintage Books}}</ref>  ===Control over information=== Control over one's personal information is the concept that “privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}<ref>The quotation is from Alan Westin.{{cite book|last1=Westin|first1=Alan F.|last2=Blom-Cooper|first2=Louis|authorlink1=Alan Westin|authorlink2=Louis Blom-Cooper|title=Privacy and freedom|date=1970|publisher=Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-0370013251|page=7}}</ref> [[Charles Fried]] said that “Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves.”{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fried|first1=Charles|authorlink1=Charles Fried|title=Privacy|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=January 1968|volume=77|issue=3|pages=475–493|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/794941}}</ref> Control over personal information is one of the more popular theories of the meaning of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}  ===Secrecy=== Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy.

Bloustein]] described this conception of privacy by saying that privacy serves to protect individuals from whatever is “demeaning to individuality”, “an affront to personal dignity”, or “an assault on human personality”.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=30}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bloustein|first1=Edward J.|authorlink1=Edward J.

This is an aspect of personal [[modesty]]. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of [[clothing|clothes]]. Other ways include erection of [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, screens, use of [[cathedral glass]], partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of [[physical intimacy]], but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.  Physical privacy could be defined as preventing \"intrusions into one's physical space or solitude.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BwQBT2Mr1YoC&pg=PA188&dq=physical+privacy&sig=dvybgqk6wfkf_xGimY8lvtWVV3I Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate America - H. Jeff]</ref> This would include concerns such as: * Preventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of [[modesty]]; apart from being [[clothing|dressed]] this can be achieved by [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, privacy screens, [[cathedral glass]], partitions between [[urinal (restroom)|urinals]], by being far away from others, on a bed by a [[bed sheet]] or a [[blanket]], when changing clothes by a [[towel]], etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being ''heard'' varies * Video, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts * Preventing searching of one's personal possessions * Preventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle * [[Medical privacy]], the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third-party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception  An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which guarantees \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 | work=Georgetown Law Journal | title=Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States | year=2002}}</ref>  Most countries have laws regarding [[trespassing]] and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.  Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or [[stalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |title=Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims |publisher=Privacyrights.org |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref> [[Civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.  ====Informational==== {{Main|Information privacy}}  Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self.  Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.  Various types of personal information are often associated with privacy concerns. Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability. First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available. Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation. An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability. Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else. This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it.  For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid [[discrimination]], personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.  [[Financial privacy]], in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of [[fraud]] including [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that [[Bank secrecy|does not share this information with other countries]] can help countries in fighting [[tax avoidance]].  [[Internet privacy]] is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used.  For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their [[email]] was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].  [[Medical privacy]] Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA] allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity.  A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to [[contraceptive security|acquire and use contraceptives]] without family, community or legal sanctions.  [[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered a basic right of [[citizenship]], despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).  Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations.  Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.  ====Organizational====  Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various [[security]] practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets.  For example, a government administration may be able to invoke [[executive privilege]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/amar/20040416.html |title=FindLaw's Writ - Amar: Executive Privilege |publisher=Writ.corporate.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref> or declare certain information to be [[Classified information|classified]], or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as [[trade secret]]s.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />  ====Spiritual and intellectual====  The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under [[British common law]], which protected \"only the physical interference of life and property.\" Its development from then on became \"one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law.\"<ref name=Solove>Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. ''Privacy, Information, and Technology'', Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9-11</ref>  Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a \"recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect.\"<ref name=Solove/> Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic \"right to be let alone\", and the former definition of \"property\" would then comprise \"every form of possession -- intangible, as well as tangible.\" By the late 19th century, interest in a \"right to privacy\" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.<ref name=Solove/>  ==History== {{further2|[[Privacy laws of the United States]]}}  ===Technology=== [[File:IllinoisTelephoneAndTelegraphAd.png|thumb|200px|Advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in [[Chicago]]. A major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was \"secret\", in that no operator was required to connect the call.]]  As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the [[printing press]] or the [[Internet]], the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the [[United States]] was the article by [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]], \"[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]\", [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html 4 ''Harvard Law Review'' 193 (1890)], that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.<ref>Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.&nbsp;P. [http://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&sort=relevancerank&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire]. and Bermann, S. (2007)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/privacy.htm |title=Privacy Law in the United States |publisher=Rbs2.com |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>  New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable. However, in 2001 in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'' (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of [[thermal imaging]] devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/ |title=Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>  Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large-scale [[information systems]] become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of [[information privacy]] has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. [[Privacy law]] in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient. Proposals such as the [[APEC]] Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.  There are various theories about privacy and privacy control. The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual. This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others. In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent. The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone’s concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance. The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a “right to privacy.” Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others. Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy. He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element. There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection. Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems. People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself. Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure. He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government. Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.  ===Internet=== {{Main|Internet privacy}}  The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: \"where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever\", writes law professor and author [[Jeffrey Rosen]].<ref name=Rosen>Rosen, Jeffrey. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=1&ref=technology \"The Web Means the End of Forgetting\"] ''New York Times'', July 19, 2010</ref>  This currently has an effect on employment. [[Microsoft]] reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and [[Twitter]]. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.<ref name=Rosen/>  The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. [[Facebook]] for example, as of July 2010, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 500 million members, or 22 percent of all Internet users, who upload over 25 billion pieces of content each month. [[Twitter]] has more than 100 million registered users. The [[Library of Congress]] recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.<ref name=Rosen/>  Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.<ref name=\"Kosinski 2013 5802–5805\">{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Stillwell, D. |author3=Graepel, T. |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=110|issue=15|pages=5802–5805|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Bachrach, Y. |author3=Stillwell, D.J. |author4=Kohli, P. |author5=Graepel, T. |title=Manifestations Of User Personality In Website Choice And Behaviour On Online Social Networks|journal=Machine Learning Journal|year=in press}}</ref> Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g. by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).

In 1960 legal scholar [[William Prosser]] created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Prosser|first1=William|authorlink1=William Prosser|title=Privacy|journal=[[California Law Review]]|date=1960|volume=48|issue=383|page=389|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol48/iss3/1}}</ref> #Intrusion into a person’s private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}} #public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}} #Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}} #Encroaching someone’s personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}  Building from this and other historical precedents, [[Daniel J. Solove]] presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}  ===Collecting information=== In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}  ===Aggregating information=== It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  *[[Data aggregation]], which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} *identification, which can mean breaking the [[de-identification]] of items of data by putting it through a [[de-anonymization]] process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} *insecurity, such as lack of [[data security]], which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a [[data breach]] which harms the people whose data it held{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} *secondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors’ [[informed consent]]{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} *exclusion is the use of a person's data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  ===Information dissemination=== Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  There are various examples of this.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person’s information private, then breaks that promise.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Appropriation is an attack on the [[personhood]] of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  ===Invasions=== [[Invasion of privacy]] is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is  an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}} \"Decisional interference\" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=104-105}}  ==Right to privacy== {{main|Right to privacy}}  Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]] wrote that privacy is the \"right to be let alone\" (Warren & Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals.  This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as [[yellow journalism]].<ref name=Brandeis>Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 \"The Right To Privacy\"], 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890)</ref>  Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his [[Louis Brandeis#Creating a Right to Privacy|''Harvard Law Review'' article]] in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying \"the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader.\" He writes, \"Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.\" At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].  ===Definitions===  In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a \"right to privacy.\" Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy \"should not be defined as a separate legal right\" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.<ref name=Haifa>Yael Onn, et al., [http://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&pg=PA1&dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&hl=en&ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''] ,  Haifa Center of Law & Technology, (2005) pp. 1-12</ref> Other experts, such as [[William Prosser|Dean Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a \"common ground\" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.<ref name=Haifa/> One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of \"privacy in the digital environment\", suggests that the \"right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself.\" It has therefore proposed a working definition for a \"right to privacy\": <blockquote>''The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.''<ref name=Haifa/></blockquote>  ===An individual \"right\"===  [[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes.  Westin defines privacy as \"the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others\". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve.  These states must balance participation against norms: <blockquote> Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives. - Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968<ref>Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York, U.S.A.: Atheneum.</ref> </blockquote>  Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].  David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy.  He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves \"the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information\".  This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally.  Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, \"[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used\".<ref>Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.</ref>  Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control.  Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency.  For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.<ref>Posner, R. A. (1981). The economics of privacy. The American Economic Review, 71(2), 405-409.</ref> For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law.  Lessig claims \"the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right\", and that \"individuals should be able to control information about themselves\".<ref>Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.</ref>  Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.  ===A collective value and a human right===  There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–442|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editor=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}</ref>   [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy.

And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Etzioni|first=Amitai|title=The Privacy Merchants: What is to be done?|journal=The Journal of Constitutional Law|date=March 2012|volume=14|issue=4|page=950|url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf}}</ref>  Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy.  She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components.  Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought.  Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power.  Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided.  Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: \"if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection\".<ref>Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.</ref>  Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy.  Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context.  The human right to privacy has precedent in the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\"<ref>United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html</ref>  Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.<ref>Shade, L.

The [[European Union]]'s 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] guides privacy protection in Europe.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}} The 2004 Privacy Framework by the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}}  In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}} [[Vance Packard]]’s ''[[The Naked Society]]'' was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3-4}}  ===Free market versus consumer protection approaches=== Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.<ref name=\"quinn\">{{cite book | title=Ethics for the Information Age  | author=Quinn, Michael J.  | year=2009  | isbn=0-321-53685-1 }}</ref>  In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share.  Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices.  Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.  In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available.  In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.<ref name=\"Jensen\">{{cite journal | title= Privacy policies as decision-making tools: an evaluation of online privacy notices | author=Jensen, Carlos | year=2004 }}</ref> Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.  ===Privacy law=== {{Main|Privacy law}}  Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals.  While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries.  For example, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 12, states:  :''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''  ====Australia==== {{main |Privacy in Australian law}}  In [[Australia]] there is the [[Privacy Act 1988]]. Privacy sector provisions of the Act apply to private sector organisations with a link to Australia, including: 1. individuals who collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of a business. For example, a sole trader's business activities will be regulated (unless it's a small business), but information gathered outside business activities won't be; 2. bodies corporate; and 3. partnerships, unincorporated associations and trusts - any act or practice of a partner, committee member or trustee is attributed to the organisation. Organisations outside Australia must comply with the provisions in some circumstances. Sending information out of Australia is also regulated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privacy.gov.au/law/act |title=Privacy Act |publisher=Privacy.gov.au |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>  ====Brazil==== The [[Constitution of Brazil]] sets privacy as a major fundamental right. Even the State is not allowed to violate personal data, intimacy, private life, honor and image (article 5, incise X). In extreme situations, a judicial order can authorize some level of disclosure. But some data, such as correspondence, are absolutely inviolable, and not even judicial order can authorize the disclosure.  ====Canada==== {{main |Canadian privacy law}}  [[Canadian privacy law]] is governed federally by multiple acts, including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act (Canada)]].  Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations. [[Data privacy]] was first addressed with the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.  ====European Union==== For [[Europe]], Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The [[European Union]] requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data]]. It is regulated in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]]  and in France [[data protection]] is also monitored by the [[CNIL]], a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before them being enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.  Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws.<ref>Burghardt, Buchmann, Böhm, Kühling, Sivridis''A Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts'' Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009.</ref> The European Union is also championing for the 'Right to be Forgotten' concept (which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from internet search engine results) to be adopted by other countries.<ref>http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/french-official-campaigns-to-make-right-to-be-forgotten-global/?ref=technology</ref>  ====Italy==== In [[Italy]] the [[right to privacy]] is enshrined in Article 15 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]], which states:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}</ref>  \"Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication is inviolable. Limitations may only be imposed by judicial decision stating the reasons and in accordance with the guarantees provided by the law.\"  ====United Kingdom==== {{main |Privacy in English law}}  In the [[United Kingdom]], it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another [[tort]] (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4482073.stm Does Beckham judgment change rules?], from [[BBC News]] (retrieved 27 April 2005).</ref> There is, however, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]; [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]; [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003]]. The ICO has also provided a \"Personal Information Toolkit\" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.<ref>[http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf \"Personal Information Toolkit\"] prepared by the Information Commissioner’s Office, UK.</ref>  ====United States==== {{main |Privacy laws of the United States}}  Concerning [[privacy laws of the United States]], individual as well as locational privacy is guaranteed by the [[Constitution of the United States]] under the 4th amendment of the constitution  .  The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has found that other guarantees have \"penumbras\" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965). In the United States, the right of [[freedom of speech]] granted in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the U.S. by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], and various state laws. Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA),<ref>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.</ref> the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLB), and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA). <ref>[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]</ref>  ===Privacy Index=== The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'s Privacy Index puts Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa in the higher level of privacy (around 2.2). On the bottom of the list are the United States and United Kingdom (around 1.4).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/by8|title=International Privacy Index |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}</ref>  ===Privacy on the Internet=== {{Main|Internet privacy}} {{see also|Right to be forgotten}} There are many means to protect one's privacy on the internet.  For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via [[S/MIME]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.<ref name=\"FederalTrade\">Federal Trade Commission (2010), \"Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers,\" Preliminary FTC Staff Report (December), available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf].</ref>  Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party [[HTTP cookies]], Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at [[Florida International University]] and privacy scholar, warns that the \"elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies.\"<ref>Miyazaki, Anthony D. (2008), \"Online Privacy and the Disclosure of Cookie Use: Effects on Consumer Trust and Anticipated Patronage,\" ''Journal of Public Policy & Marketing'', 23 (Spring), 19–33.</ref>  As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to [[behavioral advertising]].<ref name=\"FederalTrade\" /> Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: \"first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short\".<ref>Hugl, Ulrike (2011), \"Reviewing Person’s Value of Privacy of Online Social Networking,\" ''Internet Research'', 21(4), in press, http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1066-2243&volume=21&issue=4&articleid=1926600&show=abstract.</ref> This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.<ref name=\"Kosinski 2013 5802–5805\"/>  ===Privacy and location-based services===  As location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are increasing, problems related to user privacy arise, since user's position and preferences constitute personal information and improper use of them violates user's privacy. A recent MIT study<ref>{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D.

The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.  Several methods to protect user's privacy when using [[location-based service]]s have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to be able to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.<ref>Athanasios S. Voulodimos and Charalampos Z.

In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and pared with the ''[[National Do Not Call Registry]]'', telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles.<ref name = \"Telemarketers and Mobiles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sneaky-tactics-used-by-telemarketers-and-debt-collectors-to-get-your-cell-phone-number-2011-6 |title=Sneaky tactics used by telemarketers and debt collectors to get your cell phone number |publisher=Businessinsider.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both ''[[Federal Trade Commission]]'' and companies like PrivacyStar. Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.  ===Privacy by design===  The principle of [[privacy by design]] states that privacy and [[data protection]] are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of [[technologies]], from the early [[design]] stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.  ===Privacy engineering===  The practice of constructing, ostensibly, software or information systems that adhere to given privacy policies and relevant compliances is a developing area and is known as [[Privacy engineering]]  ===Privacy self-synchronization===  Privacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.<ref>Popa, C., et. all., \"Managing Personal Information: Insights on Corporate Risk and Opportunity for Privacy-Savvy Leaders\", Carswell (2012), Ch.6</ref>  ==See also== {{Portal|Mass surveillance|Computer Security}} {{col-begin}} {{Col-1-of-3}} * [[Civil liberties]] * [[Digital identity]] * [[Expectation of privacy]] * [[Identity theft]] ** [[Identity theft in the United States]] ** [[Identity Theft Resource Center]] * [[Information privacy]] * [[Information privacy law]] * [[Mind your own business]] * [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] * [[Personal rights]] * [[Personality rights]] * [[Privacy law]] ** [[Privacy laws of the United States]] * [[Privacy policy]] * [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]] * [[Privacy software]] * [[Private sphere]] * [[Privacy engineering]] * [[Privacy-enhancing technologies]] * [[Profiling (information science)]] {{Col-2-of-3}} * [[Public figure]] * [[Solitude]] * [[Sousveillance]] * [[Surveillance]] ** [[Computer and network surveillance]] ** [[Mass surveillance]] *** [[Mass surveillance in Australia]] *** [[Mass surveillance in China]] *** [[Mass surveillance in India]] *** [[Mass surveillance in East Germany]] *** [[Mass surveillance in North Korea]] *** [[Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom]] *** [[Mass surveillance in the United States]] *** [[Mass surveillance industry]] * [[Global surveillance]] ** [[2013 global surveillance disclosures]] {{Col-3-of-3}} {{col-end}}  ==References== {{reflist|colwidth=30em}}  ==Sources== *{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Solove|first1=Daniel J.|authorlink1=Daniel J.

The microplankton and smaller groups are [[microorganism]]s and operate at low [[Reynolds number]]s, where the viscosity of water is much more important than its mass or inertia. <ref>{{cite book |author=Dusenbery, David B. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Living at micro scale: the unexpected physics of being small |edition= |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-674-03116-4 |oclc= |doi= |url=}}</ref>  == Distribution == [[File:World plankton prevailence.PNG|thumb|400px|right|thumb|World distribution of plankton]] Plankton inhabit oceans, seas, lakes, ponds. Local abundance varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The primary cause of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy (but see [[chemosynthesis]]), confining primary production to surface waters, and to geographical regions and seasons having abundant light.  A secondary variable is nutrient availability. Although large areas of the [[tropics|tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] oceans have abundant light, they experience relatively low primary production because they offer limited nutrients such as [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[silicate]]. This results from large-scale [[ocean current|ocean circulation]] and water column [[Stratification (water)|stratification]]. In such regions, primary production usually occurs at greater depth, although at a reduced level (because of reduced light).  Despite significant [[macronutrient]] concentrations, some ocean regions are unproductive (so-called [[HNLC|HNLC regions]]).<ref>{{Cite journal    | last = Martin | first = J.

Paradoxically, oceanic areas adjacent to unproductive, [[arid]] land thus typically have abundant phytoplankton (e.g., the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]], where [[trade winds]] bring dust from the [[Sahara Desert]] in north [[Africa]]). While plankton are most abundant in surface waters, they live throughout the water column. At depths where no primary production occurs, [[zooplankton]] and [[bacterioplankton]] instead consume organic material sinking from more productive surface waters above. This flux of sinking material, so-called [[marine snow]], can be especially high following the termination of [[spring bloom]]s.  Traces of plankton have been found in space, on the surface of the [[International Space Station]], where they are believed to have floated from the upper atmosphere.<ref>http://tass.ru/en/non-political/745635</ref>  == Biogeochemical significance == Aside from representing the bottom few levels of a [[food chain]] that supports [[Commerce|commercially]] important [[Fishery|fisheries]], plankton [[ecosystem]]s play a role in the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s of many important [[chemical element]]s, including the ocean's [[carbon cycle]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Falkowski |first=Paul G. |year=1994 |url=ftp://marine.calpoly.edu/Needles/SPRING%2009/papers/2-Falkowski.pdf |title=The role of phytoplankton photosynthesis in global biogeochemical cycles |journal=Photosyntheis Research |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=235–258 |doi=10.1007/BF00014586}}</ref>  Primarily by grazing on phytoplankton, zooplankton  provide carbon to the planktic [[foodweb]], either [[Cellular respiration|respiring]] it to provide [[metabolism|metabolic]] energy, or upon death as [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] or [[detritus]].

This process is known as the '''[[biological pump]]''', and it is one reason that oceans constitute the largest [[carbon sink]] on [[Earth science|Earth]].  It might be possible to increase the ocean's uptake of [[Carbon dioxide#In the Earth.27s atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] generated through [[anthropogenic|human activities]] by increasing  plankton production through ''[[Iron fertilization|seeding]]'', primarily with the [[micronutrient]] [[iron]].

The chief factor limiting growth varies from region to region in the world's oceans.  On a broad scale, growth of phytoplankton in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical gyres is generally limited by nutrient supply, while light often limits phytoplankton growth in subarctic gyres.  Environmental variability at multiple scales influences the nutrient and light available for phytoplankton, and as these organisms form the base of the marine food web, this variability in phytoplankton growth influences higher trophic levels.  For example, at interannual scales phytoplankton levels temporarily plummet during [[El Niño]] periods, influencing populations of zooplankton, fishes, sea birds, and [[marine mammal]]s.  The effects of anthropogenic warming on the global population of phytoplankton is an area of active research.  Changes in the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent biological reactions, and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important impacts on future phytoplankton productivity.<ref>Steinacher, M., et al. (2010), Projected 21st century decrease in marine productivity: a multi-model analysis, Biogeosciences, 7, 979-1005</ref>  Additionally, changes in the mortality of phytoplankton due to rates of zooplankton grazing may be significant.  Freshly hatched fish larvae are also plankton for a few days, as long as it takes before they can swim against currents.  <gallery> File:Amphipodredkils.jpg|An [[amphipoda|amphipod]]: an exoskeletoned animal with curved body, with two long and two short antennae.

Fish rely on the density and distribution of zooplankton to match that of new larvae, which can otherwise starve.  Natural factors (e.g., current variations) and man-made factors (e.g. river dams) can strongly affect zooplankton, which can in turn strongly affect larval survival, and therefore breeding success.  == See also == * [[Aeroplankton]] * [[Algal bloom]] * [[Biological pump]] * [[Gelatinous zooplankton]] * [[Holoplankton]] * [[Ichthyoplankton]] * [[Iron fertilization]] * [[Meroplankton]] * [[Nekton]] * [[Ocean acidification]] * [[Paradox of the plankton]] * [[Phytoplankton]] * [[Primary production]] * [[Seston]] * [[Veliger]] * [[Zooplankton]]  == References == {{reflist|2}}  ==Further reading== *Kirby, Richard R.

The term was coined using his name after numerous instances in which demonstrations involving equipment suffered technical problems only when he was present.  The Pauli effect is not to be related with the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which is a [[good faith|bona fide]] physical phenomenon named after Pauli. However the Pauli effect was humorously tagged as a second Pauli exclusion principle, according that ''a functioning device and Wolfgang Pauli may not occupy the same room''.<ref name=eth>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/besichtigungen/objekte/paulieffekt/ |title=Der \"Pauli-Effekt\" |publisher=ETHistory |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref> Pauli himself was convinced that the effect named after him was real.<ref name=eth/> Pauli corresponded with [[Hans Bender]] and [[Carl Jung]]<ref name=eth/> and saw the effect as an example of the concept of [[synchronicity]].  == Background == Since the 20th century, the work of [[physics]] research has been divided between theorists and experimentalists (see [[scientific method]]). Only a few physicists, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], have been successful in both roles. Lacking an aptitude or interest in experimental work, many theorists have earned a reputation for accidentally breaking experimental equipment. Pauli was exceptional in this regard: it was said that he was such a good theorist that any experiments would self-destruct simply because he was in the vicinity. For fear of the Pauli effect, the experimental physicist [[Otto Stern]] banned Pauli from his laboratory in [[Hamburg]] despite their friendship.<ref>Enz (2009), p. 152.</ref> Pauli was convinced that the effect named after him was real.<ref name=\"Enz2002-150\">Enz (2002), p. 150.</ref> He corresponded with [[Carl Jung]] and [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] about the concept of [[synchronicity]] and did so as well with [[Hans Bender]], lecturer at Freiburg university Institut für Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene, the only [[parapsychology]] chair in Germany.<ref>Hans Bender und die Gründung des \"Instituts für Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene\"Eberhard Bauer, September 1997. published in Jahnke, J., Fahrenberg, J., Stegie, R., & Bauer, E.

Jung Institute]] in Zürich 1948. A famous ''Pauli effect'' at the ceremony, as he entered, a china flower vase fell on the floor without any obvious reason, caused Pauli to write his article \"Background-Physics\", in which he tries to find complementary relationships between physics and [[depth psychology]].<ref name=\"meier2001-179\">{{cite book |title=Atom and Archetype: the Pauli/Jung Letters, 1932-1958 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=[[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] |author=Pauli, Wolfgang; [[Carl Jung|Jung, C G]] |others=ed.

An expensive measuring device, for no apparent reason, suddenly stopped working, although Pauli was in fact ''absent''. [[James Franck]], the director of the institute, reported the incident to his colleague Pauli in Zürich with the humorous remark that at least this time Pauli was innocent. However, it turned out that Pauli on a railway journey to Copenhagen switched trains in Göttingen rail station about the time of failure. The incident is reported in [[George Gamow]]'s book ''Thirty Years That Shook Physics'',<ref>Thirty Years That Shook Physics: The Story of Quantum Theory, 1966, Dover Publications, ISBN 0-486-24895-X.</ref> where it is also claimed the more talented the theoretical physicist, the stronger the effect.  R. Peierls describes a case when at one reception this effect was to be parodied by deliberately crashing a chandelier upon Pauli's entrance. The chandelier was suspended on a rope to be released, but it stuck instead, thus becoming a real example of the Pauli effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peierls, R. |title=Wolfgang Ernst Pauli, 1900-1958 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume=5 |issue= |page= |year=1960 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1960.0014 }}</ref>  In 1934, Pauli saw a failure of his car during a honeymoon tour with his second wife as proof of a ''real Pauli effect'' since it occurred without an obvious external cause.<ref>Wissenschaftlicher Briefwechsel mit Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg u. a, Band 3 von Wolfgang Pauli, Karl von Meyenn, Herausgeber Karl von Meyenn, Verlag Birkhäuser, 1993, ISBN 0-387-54911-0, P. 763</ref>  In February 1950, when he was at [[Princeton University]], the [[cyclotron]] burnt, and he asked himself if this mischief belonged to such a Pauli effect, named after him.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wissenschaftlicher Briefwechsel mit Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, u.a. |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |first=Wolfgang |last=Pauli |others=ed.

He has been called \"the godfather of British comics\".<ref>Molcher, M: \"Pat Mills – the Guv'nor\", ''Judge Dredd Megazine'', #261</ref>  His comics are notable for their violence and anti-authoritarianism. He is best known for creating ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' and playing a major part in the development of ''[[Judge Dredd]]''.  ==Biography==  Mills started his career as a sub-editor for [[D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd]], where he met Wagner. In 1971 both left to go [[freelance]], and were soon writing scripts for [[IPC Media|IPC]]'s girls' and humour comics. After D.C. Thomson launched ''[[Warlord (comic)|Warlord]]'', a successful war-themed weekly, Mills was asked in 1975 to develop a rival title for IPC. Based in the girls' comics department to avoid the attention of the staff of the boys' department, Mills, along with Wagner and [[Gerry Finley-Day]], worked in secret to create ''[[Battle Picture Weekly]]''. ''Battle'''s stories were more violent and its characters more working class than IPC's traditional fare, and it was an immediate hit. Having made the comic ready for launch, Mills resigned as editor. He would later write the celebrated [[First World War]] series ''[[Charley's War]]'', drawn by [[Joe Colquhoun]], for the title.  After launching ''Battle'', Mills began developing a new boys' title, ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', launched in 1976. ''Action'''s mix of violence and anti-authoritarianism proved controversial and the title lasted less than two years before being withdrawn in the face of media protests. It was briefly revived in neutered form before being merged into ''Battle''.  His next creation was the science fiction-themed weekly ''2000 AD'', launched in 1977. As with ''Battle'' and ''Action'' he developed most of the early series before handing them over to other writers. He took over the development of ''Judge Dredd'' when creator John Wagner temporarily walked out, and wrote many of the early stories, establishing the character and his world, before Wagner returned.  In 1978 IPC launched ''[[Starlord]]'', a short-lived companion title for ''2000 AD''. Mills contributed ''[[Ro-Busters]]'', a series about a robot disaster squad, which moved to ''2000 AD'' when ''Starlord'' was cancelled.  ''Ro-Busters'' was the beginning of a mini-universe of interrelated stories Mills was to create for ''2000 AD'', including ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' and ''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]''. Artist [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] was involved in the creation of all three. ''Nemesis'' in particular, featuring a morally ambiguous alien hero fighting a despotic human empire, allowed Mills to work out his feelings towards religion and imperialism. Another strand of his ''2000 AD'' work was ''[[Sláine (comics)|Sláine]]'', a [[barbarian]] fantasy based on [[Celtic mythology]] and [[neo-paganism]], which he co-created with his then wife [[Angela Kincaid]] (with whom he also created the children's series of books, ''[[The Butterfly Children]]'').  Mills also had a hand in IPC's line of Horror comics aimed at girls such as ''[[Chiller (comics)|Chiller]]''.  He has had little success in American comics, with the exception of [[Marshal Law]], a savage [[superhero]] satire published by [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Epic Comics|Epic]] imprint in the late 1980s, drawn by O'Neill.  In 1986 he edited the short-lived comic ''[[Dice Man (comics)|Dice Man]]'', which featured characters from ''2000 AD''. He wrote nearly every story.  In 1988 he was involved in the launch of ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', a politically aware ''2000 AD'' spin-off aimed at older readers. For it he wrote ''[[Third World War (comics)|Third World War]]'', drawn initially by [[Carlos Ezquerra]], a polemical critique of global capitalism and the ways it exploits the developing world. The title lasted until 1991 and launched the careers of talents such as [[Garth Ennis]], [[John Smith (comics)|John Smith]] and [[Sean Phillips]].  In 1991 Mills launched ''[[Toxic!]]'', an independent colour newsstand weekly comic with a violent, anarchic tone, perhaps as a reaction against the politically worthy ''Crisis'', and a [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] ideal. Many of the stories were created by Mills and co-writer [[Tony Skinner]], including ''[[Accident Man]]'', an assassin who makes his hits look like accidents. ''Toxic!'' lasted less than a year, but gave a start to talents such as [[Duke Mighten]] and [[Martin Emond]].  In 1995, he broke in the French market, one of his life's goals, with ''Sha'', created with French artist [[Olivier Ledroit]].  He continues to write ''Sláine'', ''[[Bill Savage]]'', ''Black Siddha'' and ''ABC Warriors'' for ''2000 AD'', and also the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comic]] ''[[Requiem Chevalier Vampire|Requiem Vampire Knight]]'', with art by [[Olivier Ledroit]] and its spin-off [[Claudia Chevalier Vampire]], with art by [[Franck Tacito]].  Two new series, ''[[Greysuit]]'', a super-powered government agent drawn by [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]], and ''[[Defoe (comics)|Defoe]]'', a 17th-century zombie hunter drawn by [[Leigh Gallagher]], began in ''2000 AD'' prog 1540.<ref>[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=news&page=newsimage&choice=2kjun07 2000AD Online – news zone<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Mills has formed Repeat Offenders with artist [[Clint Langley]] and Jeremy Davis \"to develop graphic novel concepts with big-screen potential\" and the first project is a graphic novel called ''[[American Reaper]]'', serialised in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' (#316-ongoing as of October 2011). It has been optioned by [[Trudie Styler]]'s [[Xingu Films]] and Mills has written the screenplay.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3id4bf6e72d9d5fd611863364092cf7401 Grim 'Reaper' lands at Xingu], ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'', 29 July 2008</ref>  He has also written two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Radio drama|audio plays]], \"[[Dead London]]\" (2008) and \"[[The Scapegoat (Doctor Who audio)|The Scapegoat]]\" (2009) for [[Big Finish Productions]], featuring the [[Eighth Doctor]] and [[Lucie Miller]]. The first audio play was released as the first part of the second season of the [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Eighth Doctor New Adventures|Eighth Doctor Adventures]] and the second as part of the third season. In 2010 Mills adapted a story that had been started by him and Wagner for Doctor Who in the 1980s and was produced by Big Finish as \"[[The Song of Megaptera]]\".  ==Bibliography== {{Main|Pat Mills bibliography}} As well as his influential role in creating and contributing to numerous of British comics, Mills has produced work in both America and Europe.  ==Notes== {{reflist}}  ==Further reading== *{{cite news |first=Eoin |last=Butler |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/magazine/2010/0731/1224275568017.html |title='Comic books should strive always to be subversive.

[[Hans Eysenck|H. J. Eysenck]]'s ''Encyclopedia of Psychology'' identifies him as the founder of modern scientific [[psychiatry]], as well as of [[psychopharmacology]] and [[psychiatric genetics]]. Kraepelin believed the chief origin of psychiatric [[disease]] to be [[biological process|biological]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] malfunction. His theories dominated psychiatry at the start of the 20th century and, despite the later [[psychodynamic]] influence of [[Sigmund Freud]] and his disciples, enjoyed a revival at century's end.  == Family and early life == Kraepelin, whose father was a former opera singer, music teacher, and later successful story teller,<ref>Peter Barham (2004), ''Forgotten Lunatics of the Great War'' (New Haven: Yale) p. 163 n. 47.</ref> was born in 1856 in [[Neustrelitz]], in the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] in [[Germany]].  He was first introduced to biology by his brother Karl, 10 years older and, later, the director of the Zoological Museum of Hamburg.<ref>On Kraepelin's early life and family, see Burgmair et al., vol. I, as well as his ''Memoirs'' (Berlin: Springer, 1987).</ref>  ==Career== [[File:Kraepelin.JPG|thumb|Grave in Heidelberg (2008)]] Kraepelin began his medical studies at 18 at the [[University of Leipzig]] and completed them at the [[University of Würzburg]]. At [[Leipzig]], he studied neuropathology under [[Paul Flechsig]] and experimental psychology with [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. Kraepelin would be a disciple of Wundt and had a lifelong interest in [[experimental psychology]] based on his theories. While there, Kraepelin wrote a prize-winning essay, \"The Influence of Acute Illness in the Causation of Mental Disorders\", and at Würzburg he received his MD in 1878. In 1879, he went to work with [[Bernhard von Gudden]] at the University of Munich, where he completed his habilitation thesis, \"The Place of Psychology in Psychiatry\". Returning to the University of Leipzig in 1882, he worked in [[Wilhelm Heinrich Erb]]'s neurology clinic and in Wundt's psychopharmacology laboratory.<ref name=Alic2001>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Emil_Kraepelin.aspx#2 Kraepelin, Emil (1856–1926)] by Margaret Alic, Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology, 2001.</ref>  Kraepelin's major work, ''Compendium der Psychiatrie: Zum Gebrauche für Studirende und Aertze'' (''Compendium of Psychiatry: For the Use of Students and Physicians''), was first published in 1883 and was expanded in subsequent multivolume editions to ''Ein Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie'' (''A Texbook: Foundations of Psychiatry and Neuroscience''). In it, he argued that psychiatry was a branch of medical science and should be investigated by observation and experimentation like the other natural sciences. He called for research into the physical causes of mental illness, and started to establish the foundations of the modern classification system for mental disorders. Kraepelin proposed that by studying case histories and identifying specific disorders, the progression of mental illness could be predicted, after taking into account individual differences in personality and patient age at the onset of disease.<ref name=Alic2001/>  In 1884 he became senior physician in the Prussian provincial town of [[Leubus]] and the following year he was appointed director of the Treatment and Nursing Institute in [[Dresden]]. In 1886, at the age of 30, Kraepelin was named Professor of Psychiatry at the [[University of Dorpat]] (today the [[University of Tartu]]) in what is today [[Estonia]] (see Burgmair et al., vol. IV). Four years later, he became department head at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he remained until 1904.<ref name=Alic2001/> While at Dorpat he became the director of the 80-bed [[Tartu University Clinic|University Clinic]]. There he began to study and record many clinical histories in detail and \"was led to consider the importance of the course of the illness with regard to the classification of mental disorders\".  In 1903 Kraepelin moved to Munich to become Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the [[University of Munich]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1908.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  In 1912 at the request of the [[German Society of Psychiatry]], he began plans to establish a centre for research. Following a large donation from the Jewish German-American [[banker]] [[James Loeb]], who had at one time been a patient, and promises of support from \"patrons of science\", the [[Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry|German Institute for Psychiatric Research]] was founded in 1917 in Munich.<ref>[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/loeb/founder.html James Loeb] Harvard University Press.</ref> Initially housed in existing hospital buildings, it was maintained by further donations from Loeb and his relatives. In 1924 it came under the auspices of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science]]. The German American [[Rockefeller family]]'s [[Rockefeller Foundation]] made a large donation enabling the development of a new dedicated building for the institute, along Kraepelin's guidelines, which was officially opened in 1928.<ref name=Alic2001/>  Kraepelin spoke out against the barbarous treatment that was prevalent in the psychiatric asylums of the time, and crusaded against alcohol, capital punishment and the imprisonment rather than treatment of the insane. He rejected psychoanalytical theories that posited innate or early sexuality as the cause of mental illness, and he rejected philosophical speculation as unscientific. He focused on collecting clinical data and was particularly interested in [[neuropathology]] (e.g., diseased tissue).<ref name=Alic2001/>  In the later period of his career, as a convinced champion of [[social Darwinism]], he actively promoted a policy and research agenda in [[racial hygiene]] and [[eugenics]].<ref name=Engstrom2006>{{cite journal|author=Engstrom EJ, Weber MM, Burgmair W|title=Emil Wilhelm Magnus Georg Kraepelin (1856-1926)|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=97097|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=October 2006|volume=163|issue=10|pages=1710|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.10.1710|pmid=17012678}}.</ref>  Kraepelin retired from teaching at the age of 66, spending his remaining years establishing the Institute. The ninth and final edition of his ''Textbook'' was published in 1927, shortly after his death. It comprised four volumes and was ten times larger than the first edition of 1883.<ref name=Alic2001/>  == Theories and classification schemes == Kraepelin announced that he had found a new way of looking at mental illness, referring to the traditional view as \"symptomatic\" and to his view as \"clinical\". This turned out to be his paradigm-setting synthesis of the hundreds of mental disorders classified by the 19th century, grouping diseases together based on classification of [[syndrome]]—common ''patterns'' of symptoms over time—rather than by simple similarity of major symptoms in the manner of his predecessors. Kraepelin described his work in the 5th edition of his textbook as a \"decisive step from a symptomatic to a clinical view of insanity. . . . The importance of external clinical signs has . . . been subordinated to consideration of the conditions of origin, the course, and the terminus which result from individual disorders. Thus, all purely symptomatic categories have disappeared from the nosology\".<ref name=decker/>  === Psychosis and mood === Kraepelin is specifically credited with the classification of what was previously considered to be a [[Unitary psychosis|unitary concept of psychosis]], into two distinct forms (known as the [[Kraepelinian dichotomy]]):  * [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]] (now seen as comprising a range of mood disorders such as [[clinical depression|recurrent major depression]] and [[bipolar disorder]]), and * [[dementia praecox]].  Drawing on his long-term research, and using the criteria of course, outcome and prognosis, he developed the concept of [[dementia praecox]], which he defined as the \"sub-acute development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at a youthful age\".  When he first introduced this concept as a diagnostic entity in the fourth German edition of his ''Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie'' in 1893, it was placed among the degenerative disorders alongside, but separate from, [[catatonia]] and [[dementia paranoides]]. At that time, the concept corresponded by and large with [[Ewald Hecker]]'s [[hebephrenia]]. In the sixth edition of the ''Lehrbuch'' in 1899 all three of these clinical types are treated as different expressions of one disease, dementia praecox.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yuhas|first=Daisy|title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Has Remained a Challenge (Timeline)|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge|publisher=Scientific American Mind (March 2013)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}.</ref>  One of the cardinal principles of his method was the recognition that any given symptom may appear in virtually any one of these disorders; e.g., there is almost no single symptom occurring in dementia praecox which cannot sometimes be found in manic depression. What distinguishes each disease symptomatically (as opposed to the underlying pathology) is not any particular (pathognomonic) symptom or symptoms, but a specific pattern of symptoms. In the absence of a direct physiological or genetic test or marker for each disease, it is only possible to distinguish them by their specific pattern of symptoms. Thus, Kraepelin's system is a method for pattern recognition, not grouping by common symptoms.  Kraepelin also demonstrated specific patterns in the genetics of these disorders and specific and characteristic patterns in their course and outcome.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Generally speaking, there tend to be more schizophrenics among the relatives of schizophrenic patients than in the general population, while manic depression is more frequent in the relatives of manic depressives. Though, of course, this does not demonstrate genetic linkage, as this might be a socio-environmental factor as well.  He also reported a pattern to the course and outcome of these conditions. Kraepelin believed that schizophrenia had a deteriorating course in which mental function continuously (although perhaps erratically) declines, while manic-depressive patients experienced a course of illness which was intermittent, where patients were relatively symptom-free during the intervals which separate acute episodes. This led Kraepelin to name what we now know as schizophrenia, dementia praecox (the [[dementia]] part signifying the irreversible mental decline). It later became clear that dementia praecox did not necessarily lead to mental decline and was thus renamed [[schizophrenia]] by [[Eugen Bleuler]] to correct Kraepelin's misnomer.  In addition, as Kraepelin accepted in 1920, \"It is becoming increasingly obvious that we cannot satisfactorily distinguish these two diseases\"; however, he maintained that \"On the one hand we find those patients with irreversible dementia and severe cortical lesions. On the other are those patients whose personality remains intact\".<ref>Berrios, GE, Luque, R, Villagran, JM (2003).

''International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy'' 3, no. 2: 111–140.</ref> Nevertheless, overlap between the diagnoses and neurological abnormalities (when found) have continued, and in fact a diagnostic category of [[schizoaffective disorder]] would be brought in to cover the intermediate cases.  Kraepelin devoted very few pages to his speculations about the etiology of his two major insanities, dementia praecox and manic-depressive insanity. However, from 1896 to his death in 1926 he held to the speculation that these insanities (particularly dementia praecox) would one day probably be found to be caused by a gradual systemic or \"whole body\" disease process, probably metabolic, which affected many of the organs and nerves in the body but affected the brain in a final, decisive cascade.<ref>{{cite web|last=Noll|first=Richard|title=Whole Body Madness|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/2104852|publisher=Psychiatric Times|accessdate=26 September 2012}}.</ref>  === Psychopathic personalities === In the first through sixth edition of Kraepelin's influential psychiatry textbook, there was a section on [[moral insanity]], which meant then a disorder of the emotions or moral sense without apparent delusions or hallucinations, and which Kraepelin defined as \"lack or weakness of those sentiments which counter the ruthless satisfaction of egotism\". He attributed this mainly to degeneration. This has been described as a psychiatric redefinition of [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s theories of the \"born criminal\", conceptualised as a \"[[moral]] defect\", though Kraepelin stressed it was not yet possible to recognise them by physical characteristics.<ref name=Wetzell2000>Richard F. Wetzell (2000) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iGW7QLJmuwoC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Inventing the criminal: a history of German criminology, 1880-1945] from p 59 & 146, misc.</ref>  In fact from 1904 Kraepelin changed the section heading to \"The born criminal\", moving it from under \"Congenital feeble-mindedness\" to a new chapter on \"Psychopathic personalities\". They were treated under a theory of degeneration. Four types were distinguished: born criminals (inborn delinquents), [[pathological liars]], [[querulous]] persons, and Triebmenschen (persons driven by a basic compulsion, including [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], [[spendthrifts]], and [[dipsomaniacs]]). The concept of \"[[psychopathic]] inferiorities\" had been recently popularised in Germany by [[Julius Ludwig August Koch]], who proposed congenital and acquired types. Kraepelin had no evidence or explanation suggesting a congenital cause, and his assumption therefore appears to have been simple \"[[biologism]]\". Others, such as [[Gustav Aschaffenburg]], argued for a varying combination of causes. Kraepelin's assumption of a moral defect rather than a positive drive towards crime has also been questioned, as it implies that the moral sense is somehow inborn and unvarying, yet it was known to vary by time and place, and Kraepelin never considered that the moral sense might just be different. [[Kurt Schneider]] criticized Kraepelin's nosology for appearing to be a list of behaviors that he considered undesirable, rather than medical conditions, though Schneider's alternative version has also been criticised on the same basis. Nevertheless, many essentials of these diagnostic systems were introduced into the diagnostic systems, and remarkable similarities remain in the DSM-IV and ICD-10.<ref name=Wetzell2000/> The issues would today mainly be considered under the category of [[personality disorders]], or in terms of Kraepelin's focus on [[psychopathy]].  Kraepelin had referred to psychopathic conditions (or \"states\") in his 1896 edition, including compulsive insanity, impulsive insanity, [[homosexuality]], and mood disturbances. From 1904, however, he instead termed those \"original disease conditions, and introduced the new alternative category of psychopathic personalities. In the eighth edition from 1909 that category would include, in addition to a separate \"dissocial\" type, the excitable, the unstable, the Triebmenschen driven persons, eccentrics, the liars and swindlers, and the quarrelsome. It has been described as remarkable that Kraepelin now considered mood disturbances to be not part of the same category, but only attenuated (more mild) phases of manic depressive illness; this corresponds to current classification schemes.<ref>Henning Sass & Alan Felthous (2008) Chapter 1: History and Conceptual Development of Psychopathic Disorders in [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8WhcGo-1MkYC&dq=kurt+schneider+psychopaths&source=gbs_navlinks_s International Handbook on Psychopathic Disorders and the Law]. Edited by Alan Felthous, Henning Sass.</ref>  === Alzheimer's disease === Kraepelin postulated that there is a specific brain or other biological pathology underlying each of the major psychiatric disorders.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As a colleague of [[Alois Alzheimer]], he was a co-discoverer of [[Alzheimer's disease]], and his laboratory discovered its pathological basis. Kraepelin was confident that it would someday be possible to identify the pathological basis of each of the major psychiatric disorders.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  === Degeneration of the race === Upon moving to become Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the [[University of Munich]] in 1903, Kraepelin increasingly wrote on social policy issues. He was a strong and influential proponent of [[eugenics]] and [[racial hygiene]]. His publications included a focus on [[alcoholism]], [[crime]], [[degeneration]] and [[hysteria]].<ref name=Engstrom2007>{{cite journal|last=Engstrom|first=E.

He appears to have held [[Lamarckian]] concepts of evolution, such that cultural deterioration could be inherited. He was a strong ally and promoter of the work of fellow psychiatrist (and pupil and later successor as director of the clinic) [[Ernst Rudin]] to clarify the mechanisms of genetic inheritance as to make a so-called \"[[empirical]] genetic [[prognosis]]\".<ref name=Engstrom2007/>  Martin Brune has pointed out that Kraepelin and Rudin also appear to have been ardent advocates of a [[self-domestication]] theory, a version of [[social Darwinism]] which held that modern culture was not allowing people to be weeded out, resulting in more mental disorder and deterioration of the gene pool. Kraepelin saw a number of \"symptoms\" of this, such as \"weakening of viability and resistance, decreasing fertility, proletarianisation, and moral damage due to \"penning up people\" [''Zusammenpferchung'']. He also wrote that \"the number of idiots, epileptics, psychopaths, criminals, prostitutes, and tramps who descend from alcoholic and syphilitic parents, and who transfer their inferiority to their offspring, is incalculable\". He felt that \"the well-known example of the [[Jews]], with their strong disposition towards nervous and mental disorders, teaches us that their extraordinarily advanced domestication may eventually imprint clear marks on the race\". Brune states that Kraepelin's [[nosological]] system was \"to a great deal, built on the degeneration [[paradigm]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brüne|first=Martin|title=On human self-domestication, psychiatry, and eugenics|journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine|date=1 January 2007|volume=2|issue=1|pages=21|doi=10.1186/1747-5341-2-21|pmid=17919321|pmc=2082022|url=http://www.peh-med.com/content/2/1/21}}</ref>  == Influence == Kraepelin's great contribution in classifying schizophrenia and manic depression remains relatively unknown to the general public, and his work, which had neither the literary quality nor paradigmatic power of Freud's, is little read outside scholarly circles. Kraepelin's contributions were also to a large extent marginalized throughout a good part of the 20th century during the success of Freudian etiological theories. However, his views now dominate many quarters of psychiatric research and academic psychiatry. His fundamental theories on the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders form the basis of the major diagnostic systems in use today, especially the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSM-IV]] and the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD]] system, based on the [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] and earlier [[Feighner Criteria]] developed by espoused \"neo-Kraepelinians\", though [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] and others in the DSM committees were keen not to include assumptions about causation as Kraepelin had.<ref name=decker>[http://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/57/08/96/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1177%252F0957154X07078976.pdf Hannah S Decker, How Kraepelinian was Kraepelin?

In this role he took in clinical information from a wide range of sources and networks. Despite proclaiming high clinical standards for himself to gather information \"by means of expert analysis of individual cases\", he would also draw on the reported observations of officials not trained in psychiatry. The various editions of his textbooks do not contain detailed case histories of individuals, however, but mosaiclike compilations of typical statements and behaviors from patients with a specific diagnosis.

The term ''progressive'' was engaged to distinguish this education from the traditional Euro-American [[curricula]] of the 19th century, which was rooted in classical preparation for the [[university]] and strongly differentiated by [[social class]]. By contrast, progressive education finds its roots in present [[experience]].   Most progressive education programs have these qualities in common: {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}  * Emphasis on learning by doing – hands-on projects, expeditionary learning, [[experiential learning]] * Integrated curriculum focused on thematic units * Integration of [[entrepreneurship]] into education * Strong emphasis on [[problem solving]] and [[critical thinking]] * Group work and development of social skills * Understanding and action as the goals of learning as opposed to rote knowledge * Collaborative and [[cooperative learning]] projects * Education for [[social responsibility]] and [[democracy]] * Highly personalized education accounting for each individual's personal goals * Integration of community service and service learning projects into the daily curriculum * Selection of subject content by looking forward to ask what skills will be needed in future society * De-emphasis on textbooks in favor of varied learning resources * Emphasis on [[lifelong learning]] and social skills * Assessment by evaluation of child’s projects and productions  ==Educational theory== Progressive education can be traced back to the works of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by theorists such as Dewey. Locke believed that \"truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas\".<ref name=\"Hayes\">{{cite book |title=The progressive education movement: Is it still a factor in today's schools? |first=William |last=Hayes |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Education |year=2006}} </ref>{{rp|2}} He further discussed the need for children to have concrete experiences in order to learn. Rousseau deepened this line of thinking in [[Emile, or On Education]], where he argued that subordination of students to teachers and memorization of facts would not lead to an education.  ===Johann Bernhard Basedow=== In Germany, [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]] (1724-1790) established the Philanthropinum at [[Dessau]] in 1774. He developed new teaching methods based on conversation and play with the child, and a program of physical development. Such was his success that he wrote a treatise on his methods, \"On the best and hitherto unknown method of teaching children of noblemen\".  ===Christian Gotthilf Salzmann=== [[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann]] (1744–1811) was the founder of the [[Schnepfenthal institution]], a school dedicated to new modes of education (derived heavily from the ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]). He wrote ''Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children'', one of the first books translated into English by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].  ===Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi=== [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (1746–1827) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[pedagogue]] and educational reformer who exemplified [[Romanticism]] in his approach. He founded several educational institutions both in German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was \"Learning by head, hand and heart\". His research and theories closely resemble those outlined by Rousseau in Emile. He is further considered by many to be the “father of modern educational science”<ref name=\"Hayes\"/> His psychological theories pertain to education as they focus on the development of object teaching, that is, he felt that individuals best learned through experiences and through a direct manipulation and experience of objects. He further speculated that children learn through their own internal motivation rather than through compulsion. (See Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic motivation). A teacher's task will be to help guide their students as individuals through their learning and allow it to unfold naturally.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Education in American Culture |first1=R Freeman |last1=Butts |first2=Lawrence |last2=Cremin |year=1958 }}</ref>  ===Friedrich Fröbel=== [[Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]] (1782 – 1852) was a student of Pestalozzi who laid the foundation for modern [[education]] based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities. He believed in “self-activity” and play as essential factors in child education. The teacher’s role was not to indoctrinate but to encourage self-expression through play, both individually and in group activities. He created the concept of [[kindergarten]].  ===Johann Friedrich Herbart=== [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] (1776–1841) emphasized the connection between individual development and the resulting societal contribution. The five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were Inner Freedom, Perfection, Benevolence, Justice, and Equity or Recompense.<ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Blyth |first=A. |year=1981 |title=From individuality to character: the Herbartian sociology applied to education| journal=British Journal of Educational Studies|volume=29 |number=1 |pages=69–79 |accessdate=September 7, 2007 |doi=10.2307/3120425}}</ref> According to Herbart, abilities were not innate but could be instilled, so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development.  In order to develop a child to lead to a consciousness of social responsibility, Herbart advocated that teachers utilize a methodology with five formal steps: “Using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of interest to the children, presented that topic, and questioned them inductively, so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known, looked back, and deductively summed up the lesson’s achievements, then related them to moral precepts for daily living”.<ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Miller |first=E.J. |year=2003|title=Teaching methods, the Herbartian revolution and Douglas Clay Ridgley at Illinois State Normal University |journal=Journal of Geography|volume=102 |accessdate= September 7, 2007|page=114 |doi=10.1080/00221340308978532}}</ref>  ===John Melchior Bosco=== [[Don Bosco|John Melchior Bosco]] (1815 – 1888) was concerned about the education of street children who had left their villages to find work in the rapidly industrialized city of [[Turin]], Italy. Exploited as cheap labor or imprisoned for unruly behavior, Bosco saw the need of creating a space where they would feel at home. He called it an 'Oratory' where they could play, share friendships and develop their creative talents. He taught them various skills for gainful self-employment. With those who had found work, he set up a mutual-fund society (an early version of the [[Grameen Bank]]) to teach them the benefits of saving and self-reliance. The principles underlying his educational method that won over the hearts and minds of thousands of youth who flocked to his oratory were: 'be reasonable', 'be kind', 'believe' and 'be generous in service'. Today his method of education is practiced in nearly 3000 institutions set up around the world by the members of the [[Salesian Society]] he founded in 1873.  ===Cecil Reddie=== While studying for his doctorate in [[Göttingen]] in 1882-1883, [[Cecil Reddie]] was greatly impressed by the progressive educational theories being applied there.  Reddie founded [[Abbotsholme School]] in [[Derbyshire]], [[England]] in 1889. Its curriculum enacted the ideas of progressive education. Reddie rejected rote learning, classical languages and corporal punishment. He combined studies in modern languages and the sciences and arts with a program of physical exercise, manual labour, recreation, crafts and arts. Abbotsholme was imitated throughout Europe and was particularly influential in Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/494634/Cecil-Reddie |title=Encycolpedia Britannica |accessdate=10 October 2013 }}</ref> He often engaged foreign teachers, who learned its practices, before returning home to start their own schools.

John Dewey, a principal figure in this movement from the 1880s to 1904, set the tone for educational philosophy as well as concrete school reforms. His thinking had been influenced by the ideas of Fröbel and Herbart.<ref>{{cite book |title=Froebel's Educational Principles |first=John |last=Dewey |chapter=5 |publisher=University of Chicago |year= 1915 |pages=111–127 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Development of Education in the Twentieth Century |first=Adolphe Erich |last=Meyer |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1939 }}</ref> His reactions to the prevailing theories and practices in education, corrections made to these philosophies, and recommendations to teachers and administrators to embrace “the new education,” provide a vital account of the history of the development of educational thinking in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

His theoretical standpoints are divided into five sections outlined below.  ====What Education Is==== Education according to Dewey is the “participation of the individual in the social consciousness of the race” (Dewey, 1897, para. 1).  As such, education should take into account that the student is a social being. The process begins at birth with the child unconsciously gaining knowledge and gradually developing their knowledge to share and partake in society.  The educational process has two sides, the psychological and the sociological, with the psychological forming the basis. (Dewey, 1897). A child’s own instincts will help develop the material that is presented to them. These instincts also form the basis of their knowledge with everything building upon it. This forms the basis of Dewey’s assumption that one cannot learn without motivation.  Knowledge is a social condition and it is important to help students construct their own learning, as stated: “Hence it is impossible to prepare the child for any precise set of conditions. To prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities; that his eye and ear and hand may be tools ready to command, that his judgment may be capable of grasping the conditions under which it has to work, and the executive forces be trained to act economically and efficiently” (Dewey, 1897, Para. 7)  Instruction must focus on the child as a whole for you can never be sure as to where society may end or where that student will be needed or will take themselves.  ====What the school is==== “Education fails because it neglects this fundamental principle of the school as a form of community life. It conceives the school as a place where certain information is to be given, where certain lessons are to be learned, or where certain habits are to be formed” (Dewey, 1897, para. 17) Dewey felt that as education is a social construct, it is therefore a part of society and should reflect the community.  \"Education is the process of living and is not meant to be the preparation of future living,\" (Dewey, 1897), so school must represent the present life. As such, parts of the student’s home life (such as moral and ethical education) should take part in the schooling process. The teacher is a part of this, not as an authoritative figure, but as a member of the community who is there to assist the student.  ====The subject matter of education==== According to Dewey, the curriculum in the schools should reflect that of society. The center of the school curriculum should reflect the development of humans in society. The study of the core subjects (language, science, history) should be coupled with the study of cooking, sewing and manual training. Furthermore, he feels that “progress is not in the succession of studies but in the development of new attitudes towards, and new interests in, experience” (Dewey, 1897, para. 38)  ====The nature of method==== Method is focused on the child’s powers and interests. If the child is thrown into a passive role as a student, absorbing information, the result is a waste of the child’s education. (Dewey, 1897). Information presented to the student will be transformed into new forms, images and symbols by the student so that they fit with their development and interests. The development of this is natural. To repress this process and attempt to “substitute the adult for the child” (Dewey, 1897, para. 52) would weaken the intellectual curiosity of the child.  ====The school and social progress==== Education is the most fundamental method of social reconstruction for progress and reform. Dewey believes that “education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction” (Dewey, 1897, para. 60). As such, Dewey gives way to Social Reconstruction and schools as means to reconstruct society (See Social Reconstruction in Education).  Finally, as schools become a means for social reconstruction, our educations must be given the proper equipment to help perform this task and guide their students.<ref>Dewey, John. (1897).

The Laborschule explicitly uses democratic concepts as suggested by Dewey. Studies in the last years have proven the successful implementation of these concepts into a living community.  ===Rudolf Steiner=== [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1869-1925) first described the principles of what was to become [[Waldorf education]] in 1907. He established a series of schools based on these principles beginning in 1919. The focus of the education is on creating a developmentally-appropriate curriculum that holistically integrates practical, artistic, social, and academic experiences.<ref>* [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/steinere.pdf Heiner Ullrich, \"Rudolf Steiner\"], ''Prospects: the quarterly review of comparative education'' (Paris, UNESCO: International Bureau of Education), vol.XXIV, no. 3/4, 1994, p.&nbsp;555–572</ref><ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-big-question-who-was-rudolf-steiner-and-what-were-his-revolutionary-teaching-ideas-433407.html “Who was Rudolf Steiner and what were his revolutionary teaching ideas?” [[Richard Garner]], Education Editor, ''The Independent'']</ref> There are more than a thousand schools and many more [[early childhood]] centers worldwide; it has also become a popular form of [[homeschooling]].<ref name=schulliste>[http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Waldorf_World_List/Waldorf_World_List.pdf Statistics for Waldorf schools worldwide]</ref><ref>M.

She based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as \"scientific pedagogy\". Although Montessori education spread to the United States in 1911 there were conflicts with the American educational establishment and was opposed by William Heard Kilpatrick. However Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there.  ===Robert Baden-Powell=== In July 1906, [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] sent [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] a copy of his book ''The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians''. Seton was a British-born Canadian-American living in the United States. They shared ideas about youth training programs.<ref name=\"SetonInfed\">{{cite web |year=2002 |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/seton.htm |title=Ernest Thompson Seton and Woodcraft |publisher=InFed |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name=\"BPInfed\">{{cite web |year=2002 |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-bp.htm |title=Robert Baden-Powell as an Educational Innovator |publisher=InFed |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref> In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called ''Boy Patrols''.

The Brownsea camp and the publication of  ''Scouting for Boys'' are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement which spread throughout the world. Baden-Powell and his sister [[Agnes Baden-Powell]] introduced the [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides]] in 1910.  ===Comparison with traditional education=== {{Main|Traditional education}}  Traditional education uses extrinsic motivation, such as grades and prizes. Progressive education is more likely to use intrinsic motivation, basing activities on the interests of the child.

He had been influenced by Cecil Reddie. The [[Modern Schools]], also called 'Ferrer Schools', that were founded in the United States, were based on Escuela Moderna. As in Spain the schools were intended to educate the working-classes from a [[secular]], [[class-conscious]] perspective. The Modern Schools imparted day-time academic classes for children, and night-time continuing-education lectures for adults.  ===United Kingdom=== The ideas from Reddie's Abbotsholme spread to schools such as [[Bedales School]] (1893), [[King Alfred School, London]] (1898) and [[St Christopher School, Letchworth]] (1915), as well as all the [[Quakers|Friends’]] schools, [[Waldorf education|Steiner Waldorf]] schools and those belonging to the [[Round Square|Round Square Conference]]. The King Alfred School was radical for its time in that it provided a secular education and that boys and girls were educated together.<ref name=\"proged\">[http://www.kingalfred.org.uk/king-alfred-school/about-king-alfred-school/progressive-education.html A Progressive Education]</ref> [[Alexander Sutherland Neill]] believed children should achieve self-determination and should be encouraged to think critically rather than blindly obeying. He implemented his ideas with the founding of [[Summerhill School]] in 1921. Neill believed that children learn better when they are not compelled to attend lessons. The school was also managed democratically, with regular meetings to determine school rules. Pupils had equal voting rights with school staff.  ===United States===  ====Early practitioners==== Fröbel’s student [[Margarethe Schurz]] founded the first kindergarten in the [[United States]] at [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1856, and she also inspired [[Elizabeth Peabody]], who went on to found the first English-speaking kindergarten in the United States – the language at Schurz’s kindergarten had been German, to serve an immigrant community – in [[Boston]] in 1860. This paved the way for the concept’s spread in the USA. The German émigré Adolph Douai had also founded a kindergarten in Boston in 1859, but was obliged to close it after only a year. By 1866, however, he was founding others in [[New York City]].  [[William Heard Kilpatrick]] (1871–1965) was a pupil of Dewey and one of the most effective practitioners of the concept as well as the more adept at proliferating the progressive education movement and spreading word of the works of Dewey. He is especially well known for his “project method of teaching”.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/> This developed the progressive education notion that students were to be engaged and taught so that their knowledge may be directed to society for a socially useful need. Like Dewey he also felt that students should be actively engaged in their learning rather than actively disengaged with the simple reading and regurgitation of material.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/>  The most famous early practitioner of progressive education was [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; its best-known spokesperson was the philosopher [[John Dewey]].  In 1875 Francis Parker became superintendent of schools in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] after spending two years in [[Germany]] studying emerging educational trends on the continent. Parker was opposed to rote learning, believing that there was no value in knowledge without understanding. He argued instead schools should encourage and respect the child’s creativity. Parker’s [[Quincy Method|Quincy System]] called for child-centered and experience-based learning.   He replaced the traditional curriculum with integrated learning units based on core themes related to the knowledge of different disciplines. He replaced traditional readers, spellers and [[grammar]] books with children’s own writing, [[literature]], and teacher prepared materials. In 1883 Parker left Massachusetts to become Principal of the Cook County Normal School in [[Chicago]], a school that also served to train teachers in Parker’s methods. In 1894 Parker’s Talks on Pedagogics, which drew heavily on the thinking of [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]], became one of the first American writings on education to gain international fame.  That same year, philosopher John Dewey moved from the [[University of Michigan]] to the newly established [[University of Chicago]] where he became chair of the department of [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and education. He and his wife enrolled their children in Parker’s school before founding their own school two years later.  Whereas Parker started with practice and then moved to theory, Dewey began with hypotheses and then devised methods and curricula to test them. By the time Dewey moved to Chicago at the age of thirty-five, he had already published two books on psychology and applied psychology. He had become dissatisfied with philosophy as pure speculation and was seeking ways to make philosophy directly relevant to practical issues. Moving away from an early interest in [[Hegel]], Dewey proceeded to reject all forms of [[dualism]] and dichotomy in favor of a philosophy of experience as a series of unified wholes in which everything can be ultimately related.  In 1896, John Dewey opened what he called the laboratory school to test his theories and their sociological implications. With Dewey as the director and his wife as principal, the University of Chicago Laboratory school, was dedicated “to discover in administration, selection of subject-matter, methods of learning, teaching, and [[discipline]], how a school could become a cooperative community while developing in individuals their own capacities and satisfy their own needs.” (Cremin, 136) For Dewey the two key goals of developing a cooperative [[community]] and developing [[individual]]s’ own capacities were not at odds; they were necessary to each other. This unity of purpose lies at the heart of the progressive education philosophy. In 1912, Dewey sent out students of his philosophy to found [[The Park School of Buffalo]] and [[The Park School of Baltimore]] to put it into practice. These schools operate to this day within a similar progressive approach.  At Columbia, Dewey worked with other educators such as Charles Eliot and Abraham Flexner to help bring progressivism into the mainstream of American education. In 1917 Columbia established the Lincoln School of Teachers College “as a laboratory for the working out of an elementary and secondary curriculum which shall eliminate obsolete material and endeavor to work up in usable form material adapted to the needs of modern living.” (Cremin, 282)  Based on Flexner’s demand that the modern curriculum “include nothing for which an affirmative case can not be made out” (Cremin, 281) the new school organized its activities around four fundamental fields: [[science]], [[industry]], [[aesthetics]] and [[civics]]. The Lincoln School built its curriculum around “units of work” that reorganized traditional subject matter into forms embracing the development of [[child]]ren and the changing needs of adult life. The first and second grades carried on a study of community life in which they actually built a city. A third grade project growing out of the day-to-day life of the nearby [[Hudson River]] became one of the most celebrated units of the school, a unit on boats, which under the guidance of its legendary teacher Miss Curtis, became an entrée into [[history]], [[geography]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[arithmetic]], science, [[art]] and literature. Each of the units was broadly enough conceived so that different children could concentrate on different aspects depending on their own interests and needs. Each of the units called for widely diverse student activities, and each sought to deal in depth with some critical aspect of contemporary civilization. Finally each unit engaged children working together cooperatively and also provided opportunities for individual research and exploration.  In 1924, [[Agnes de Lima]], the lead writer on education for [[The New Republic]] and [[The Nation|Nation]], published a collection of her articles on progressive education as a book, titled ''Our Enemy the Child''.<ref>Agnes de Lima.  In James Guthrie, Editor in Chief, ''Encyclopedia of Education'' (pp.&nbsp;553–554).  New York: Thomson Gale (2003).</ref>   In 1918 The [[National Education Association]], representing superintendents and administrators in smaller districts across the country, issued its report \"Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education.\"  It emphasized the education of students in terms of health, a command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. They Emphasized life adjustment and reflected the social efficiency model of progressive education.<ref>Karen Graves, \"The Cardinal Principles,,\" ''American Educational History Journal'' (2010) 37#1-2, pp 95-107</ref>   From 1919 to 1955 the Progressive Education Association founded by [[Stanwood Cobb#Career as educator|Stanwood Cobb]] and others worked to promote a more student-centered approach to education. During the [[Great Depression]] the organization conducted an Eight Year study evaluating the effects of progressive programs. More than 1500 students over four years were compared to an equal number of carefully matched students at conventional schools. When they reached college, the experimental students were found to equal or surpass traditionally educated students on all outcomes: grades, extracurricular participation, dropout rates, intellectual curiosity, and resourcefulness. Moreover, the study found that the more the school departed from the traditional college preparatory program, the better was the record of the graduates. (Kohn, Schools, 232)  By mid-century many public school programs had also adopted elements of progressive curriculum. At mid-century Dewey believed that progressive education had “not really penetrated and permeated the foundations of the educational institution.”(Kohn, Schools, 6,7)  As the influence of progressive pedagogy grew broader and more diffuse, practitioners began to vary their application of progressive principles.   As varying interpretations and practices made evaluation of progressive reforms more difficult to assess, critics began to propose alternative approaches.  The seeds of the debate over progressive education can be seen in the differences of Parker and Dewey. These have to do with how much and by whom curriculum should be worked out from grade to grade, how much the child’s emerging interests should determine classroom activities, the importance of child-centered vs. societal–centered learning, the relationship of community building to individual growth, and especially the relationship between emotion, thought and experience.  In 1955 the publication of Rudolf Flesch's ''[[Rudolf Flesch#Professional Information|Why Johnny Can’t Read]]'' leveled criticism of reading programs at the progressive emphasis on reading in context. The conservative [[McCarthy era]] raised questions about the liberal ideas at the roots of the progressive reforms. The launching of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 at the height of the [[cold war]] gave rise to a number of intellectually competitive approaches to disciplinary knowledge, such as [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study|BSCS]] biology [[Physical Science Study Committee|PSSC]] physics, led by university professors such as [[Jerome Bruner]] and [[Jerrold Zacharias]].  Interestingly, some of the cold war reforms incorporated elements of progressivism. For example, the work of Zacharias and Bruner was based in the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] and incorporated many of Dewey’s ideas of experiential education. Bruner’s analysis of developmental psychology became the core of a pedagogical movement known as [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], which argues that the child is an active participant in making meaning and must be engaged in the progress of education for learning to be effective. This psychological approach has deep connections to the work of both Parker and Dewey and led to a resurgence of their ideas in second half of the century.  In 1965, President Johnson inaugurated the [[Great Society]] and the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] suffused public school programs with funds for sweeping education reforms. At the same time the influx of federal funding also gave rise to demands for accountability and the behavioral objectives approach of Robert F. Mager and others foreshadowed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] passed in 2002. Against these critics eloquent spokespersons stepped forward in defense of the progressive tradition.

Despite the variations that still exist among the progressive programs throughout the country, most progressive schools today are vitalized by these common practices:  * The curriculum is more flexible and is influenced by student interest * Teachers are facilitators of learning who encourage students to use a wide variety of activities to learn * Progressive teachers use a wider variety of materials allowing for individual and group research. * Progressive teachers encourage students to learn by discovery * Progressive education programs often include the use of community resources and encourage service-learning projects.  ====Education outside of schools==== Organizations like the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and [[Camp Fire]] arose, even amidst concerns by opponents of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]], because some people felt that [[social welfare]] of young men should be maintained through education alone.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} After decades of growing interest in and development of [[experiential education]] and [[scouting in the United States|scouting (not Scouting) in the United States]], and the emergence of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]] in 1907, in 1910 Boy Scouts of America was founded in the merger of three older [[Scouting]] organizations: Boy Scouts of the United States, the National Scouts of America and the Peace Scouts of California.<ref name=\"americanadv\">{{cite book |author=Peterson, Robert W. |title=The Boy Scouts: An American Adventure |publisher=American Heritage |year=1984 |isbn=0-8281-1173-1}}</ref> Its founder, Chicago publisher [[William D.

Each electrode may become either the anode or the cathode depending on the direction of current through the cell. A bipolar electrode is an electrode that functions as the anode of one cell and the cathode of another cell.  === Primary cell === A [[primary cell]] is a special type of electrochemical cell in which the reaction cannot be reversed, and the identities of the anode and cathode are therefore fixed. The anode is always the negative electrode. The cell can be discharged but not recharged.  === Secondary cell === A [[secondary cell]], for example a [[rechargeable battery]], is a cell in which the chemical reactions are reversible. When the cell is being charged, the anode becomes the positive (+) and the cathode the negative (−) electrode. This is also the case in an [[electrolytic cell]]. When the cell is being discharged, it behaves like a primary cell, with the anode as the negative and the cathode as the positive electrode.  ==Other anodes and cathodes == In a [[vacuum tube]] or a [[semiconductor]] having polarity ([[diode]]s, [[electrolytic|electrolytic capacitor]]s) the anode is the positive (+) electrode and the cathode the negative (−). The electrons enter the device through the cathode and exit the device through the anode. Many devices have other electrodes to control operation, e.g., base, gate, control grid.  In a three-electrode cell, a counter electrode, also called an [[auxiliary electrode]], is used only to make a connection to the electrolyte so that a current can be applied to the working electrode. The counter electrode is usually made of an inert material, such as a [[noble metal]] or [[graphite]], to keep it from dissolving.  == Welding electrodes == In [[arc welding]] an electrode is used to conduct current through a workpiece to fuse two pieces together. Depending upon the process, the electrode is either consumable, in the case of [[gas metal arc welding]] or [[shielded metal arc welding]], or non-consumable, such as in [[gas tungsten arc welding]]. For a direct current system the weld rod or stick may be a cathode for a filling type weld or an anode for other welding processes. For an alternating current arc welder the welding electrode would not be considered an anode or cathode.  == Alternating current electrodes == For electrical systems which use [[alternating current]] the electrodes are the connections from the circuitry to the object to be acted upon by the electric current but are not designated anode or cathode because the direction of flow of the electrons changes [[alternating current|periodically]], usually many [[hertz|times per second]].  == Uses == Electrodes are used to provide current through nonmetal objects to alter them in numerous ways and to measure conductivity for numerous purposes. Examples include: *Electrodes for [[fuel cell]]s *Electrodes for medical purposes, such as [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] (for recording brain activity), [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] (recording [[Cardiac cycle|heart beats]]), [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] (electrical brain stimulation), [[defibrillator]] (recording and delivering cardiac stimulation) *Electrodes for [[electrophysiology]] techniques in biomedical research *Electrodes for execution by the [[electric chair]] *Electrodes for [[electroplating]] *Electrodes for [[arc welding]] *Electrodes for [[cathodic protection]] *Electrodes for [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] *Electrodes for [[chemical analysis]] using [[electrochemical]] methods *Inert electrodes for [[electrolysis]] (made of [[platinum]]) *[[Membrane electrode assembly]]  ==Chemically modified electrodes== [[Chemically modified electrode]]s are electrodes that have their surfaces chemically modified to change the electrode's [[Physical property|physical]], [[chemical]], [[electrochemical]], [[optical]], [[electrical]], and [[transport]] properties.

Whether applied to medical education, decisions about individuals, guidelines and policies applied to populations, or administration of health services in general, evidence-based medicine advocates that to the greatest extent possible, decisions and policies should be based on evidence, not just the beliefs of practitioners, experts, or administrators. It thus tries to assure that a [[clinician]]'s opinion, which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases, is supplemented with all available knowledge from the [[scientific literature]] so that [[best practice]] can be determined and applied. It promotes the use of formal, explicit methods to analyze evidence and make it available to decision makers. It promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students, practitioners, and policy makers.  ==Background, history and definition== In its broadest form, evidence-based medicine is the application of the scientific method into healthcare decision-making. Medicine has a long tradition of both basic and clinical research that dates back at least to [[Avicenna]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brater DC, Daly WJ |title=Clinical pharmacology in the Middle Ages: principles that presage the 21st century |journal=Clin.

Called \"clinical judgment\" and \"the art of medicine\", the traditional approach to making decisions about individual patients depended on having each individual physician determine what research evidence, if any, to consider, and how to merge that evidence with personal beliefs and other factors. In the case of decisions that applied to groups of patients or populations, the guidelines and policies would usually be developed by committees of experts, but there was no formal process for determining the extent to which research evidence should be considered or how it should be merged with the beliefs of the committee members. There was an implicit assumption that decision makers and policy makers would incorporate evidence in their thinking appropriately, based on their education, experience, and ongoing study of the applicable literature.   ===Clinical decision making=== Beginning in the late 1960s, several flaws became apparent in the traditional approach to medical decision-making. [[Alvan Feinstein]]'s publication of ''Clinical Judgment'' in 1967 focused attention on the role of clinical reasoning and identified biases that can affect it.<ref name=\"feinstein\">{{cite book|author=Alvan R.

Chronologically, the first is the insistence on explicit evaluation of evidence of effectiveness when issuing clinical practice guidelines and other population-level policies. The second is the introduction of epidemiological methods into medical education and individual patient-level decision-making.  ===Evidence-based guidelines and policies=== The term \"evidence-based\" was first used by David M. Eddy in the course of his work on population-level policies such as clinical practice guidelines and insurance coverage of new technologies. He first began to use the term \"evidence-based\" in 1987 in workshops and a manual commissioned by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to teach formal methods for designing clinical practice guidelines. The manual was widely available in unpublished form in the late 1980s and eventually published by the American College of Medicine.<ref name=\"eddy4\">{{Cite book|author=Eddy DM|title=A Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Policies |publisher=American College of Physicians|date=1992 |isbn=0943126185}}</ref><ref name=\"field\">{{cite book |author=Committee to Advise the Public Health Service on Clinical Practice Guidelines, Institute of Medicine |editor-last=Field |editor-first=M.J. |editor2-last=Lohr |editor2-first=K.N.  |title=Clinical Practice Guidelines: Directions for a New Program |publisher=National Academy of Sciences Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-309-07666-1 |page=32 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1626&page=32}}</ref> Eddy first published the term \"evidence-based\" in March, 1990 in an article in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' that laid out the principles of evidence-based guidelines and population-level policies, which Eddy described as \"explicitly describing the available evidence that pertains to a policy and tying the policy to evidence. Consciously anchoring a policy, not to current practices or the beliefs of experts, but to experimental evidence. The policy must be consistent with and supported by evidence. The pertinent evidence must be identified, described, and analyzed. The policymakers must determine whether the policy is justified by the evidence.

The methods were published to a broad physician audience in a series of 25 \"Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature\" published in ''JAMA'' between 1993 and 2000 by the Evidence based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University. Other definitions for individual level evidence-based medicine have been put forth. For example, in 1995 Rosenberg and Donald defined it as \"the process of finding, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for medical decisions.\"<ref name=\"rosenberg2\">{{cite journal|author=Rosenberg W, Donald A|title=Evidence-based Medicine: An approach to Clinical Problem Solving|journal=BMJ|volume=310|pages=1122–6|doi=10.1136/bmj.310.6987.1122 |year=1995 |pmid=7742682 |pmc=2549505 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7742682}}</ref> In 2010, Greenhalgh used a definition that emphasized quantitative methods: \"the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in the diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients.\"<ref name=\"greenhalgh1\">{{cite book|last=Greenhalgh |first=Trisha |authorlink=Trisha Greenhalgh|date=2010|title=How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence-Based Medicine (4th ed.)|publisher= John Wiley & Sons|page= 1|isbn=978-1-4443-9036-0}}</ref> Many other definitions have been offered for individual level evidence-based medicine, but the one by Sackett and colleagues is the most commonly cited.<ref name=sackett2 />  The two original definitions highlight important differences in how evidence-based medicine is applied to populations versus individuals.

On the medical education side, programs to teach evidence-based medicine have been created in medical schools in Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, and other countries. A 2009 study of UK programs found the more than half of UK medical schools offered some training in evidence-based medicine, although there was considerable variation in the methods and content, and EBM teaching was restricted by lack of curriculum time, trained tutors and teaching materials.<ref name=\"medteach\">{{cite journal|author=Meats E1, Heneghan C, Crilly M, Glasziou P|title=Evidence-based medicine teaching in UK medical schools|journal=Med Teach|date=April 2009|volume=31|issue=4|pages=332–7|doi=10.1080/01421590802572791 |pmid=19404893 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01421590802572791}}</ref> Many programs have been developed to help individual physicians gain better access to evidence.

By 2000, \"evidence-based medicine\" had become an umbrella term for the emphasis on evidence in both population-level and individual-level decisions. In subsequent years, use of the term \"evidence-based\" had extended to other levels of the health care system. An example is \"evidence-based health services\", which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level.<ref name=\"gray\">{{cite book|author=Gray, J. A. Muir|date=2009|title=Evidence-based Health Care & Public Health|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=9780443101236}}</ref> The concept has also spread outside of healthcare; for example, in his 1996 inaugural speech as President of the Royal Statistical Society, Adrian Smith proposed that \"[[evidence-based policy]]\" should be established for education, prisons and policing policy and all areas of government work.  The multiple tributaries of evidence based medicine share an emphasis on the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions. However they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promulgating a guideline or payment policy, and they differ on the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual-level information in decisions. Thus, evidence-based guidelines and policies may not readily 'hybridise' with experience-based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement, and can lead to contradictions, contest, and unintended crises.<ref name=eddy5 /> The most effective 'knowledge leaders' (managers and clinical leaders) use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making, rather than just formal evidence.<ref name=feinstein2 /> Evidence-based guidelines may provide the basis for [[governmentality]] in health care and consequently play a central role in the distant governance of contemporary health care systems.<ref name=sackett />  ==Methods==  ===Steps=== The steps for designing explicit, evidence based guidelines were described in the late 1980s: Formulate the question (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcomes, time horizon, setting); search the literature to identify studies that inform the question; interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question; if several studies address the question, synthesize their results (meta-analysis); summarize the evidence in \"evidence tables\"; compare the benefits, harms and costs in a \"balance sheet\"; draw a conclusion about the preferred practice; write the guideline; write the rationale for the guideline; have others review each of the previous steps; implement the guideline.<ref name=eddy4/>  For the purposes of medical education and individual-level decision making, five steps of EBM in practice were described in 1992<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cook DJ, Jaeschke R, Guyatt GH |title=Critical appraisal of therapeutic interventions in the intensive care unit: human monoclonal antibody treatment in sepsis.

In contrast, patient testimonials, case reports, and even expert opinion (however some critics have argued that expert opinion \"does not belong in the rankings of the quality of [[empirical evidence]] because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence\" and continue that \"expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone.\")<ref name=\"Tonelli99\">{{cite journal |author=Tonelli MR |title=In defense of expert opinion |journal=Acad Med |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1187–92 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10587679  |doi=10.1097/00001888-199911000-00010}}</ref> have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more.

Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients. * Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that there are benefits provided by the clinical service, but the balance between benefits and risks are too close for making general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless there are individual considerations. * Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients. * Level I: Scientific evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed.

A system was developed by the GRADE working group and takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research.<ref name=\"GRADE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ |title=GRADE working group |accessdate=2007-09-24 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5EyFmnBjw | archivedate = 2006-04-07| deadurl=no}}</ref> It requires users of GRADE (short for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a systematic review, to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results. Authors of GRADE tables, grade the quality of evidence into four levels, on the basis of their confidence in the observed effect (a numerical value) being close to what the true effect is. The confidence value is based on judgements assigned in five different domains in a structured manner.<ref name=\"balshem2011\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Balshem H, Helfand M, Schünemann HJ, etal |title=GRADE guidelines: 3.

This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.  Meaning of the levels of Quality of evidence as per GRADE<ref name=\"balshem2011\"/> * High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the estimate that is presented lies very close to the true value. One could interpret it as: there is very low probability of further research completely changing the presented conclusions. * Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. One could also interpret it as: further research may completely change the conclusions. * Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate and the true value may be substantially different. One could interpret it as: further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely. * Very low quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. One could interpret it as: New research will most probably change the presented conclusions completely.  Guideline panelists may make '''Strong''' or '''Weak recommendations''' on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are:<ref name=\"GRADE Handbook\"/> * Balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost) * Quality of the evidence * Values and preferences * Costs (resource utilization)  Despite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.  ===Statistical measures=== Evidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:  *Likelihood ratio {{main|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}} The [[pre-test odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[pre- and post-test probability|post-test odds]]. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects [[Bayes' theorem]]. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation. *AUC-ROC The area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between [[sensitivity and specificity]] for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC. *Number needed to treat / harm. Number needed to treat or Number needed to harm are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful. NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome (e.g. survival from cancer) in one patient. For example if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5%, then 20 people need to be treated in order to have 1 additional patient survive due to the treatment. The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests. For example if 1339 women age 50 -59 have to be invited for breast cancer screening over a ten year period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer,<ref name=\"BandolierStatins2004\">\"Patient Compliance with statins\" ''[[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] [http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html Review] 2004</ref> then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339.  ===Quality of clinical trials=== Evidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.  *Trial design considerations. High-quality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data.  *Generalizability considerations. Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts.  *Follow-up. Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the prospective study outcomes and the [[statistical power]] of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm.  *Power. A mathematical calculation can determine if the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms. A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit, or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference.  ==Limitations and criticism== Although evidence-based medicine is regarded as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of [[conventional medicine|clinical practice]], there are a number of limitations and criticisms of its use<ref name=\"Timmermans2005\">{{cite journal |author=Timmermans S, Mauck A |title=The promises and pitfalls of evidence-based medicine |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18–28 |year=2005 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/1/18.long |pmid=15647212 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.18 }}</ref> many of which remain unresolved despite nearly two centuries of debate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poisson, Dulong, Larrey, Double |title=Statistical research on conditions caused by calculi by Doctor Civiale. |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=1246–9 |year=2001 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.6.1246 |url=http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1246 |origyear=1835 |pmid=11821317}}</ref>  * EBM produces quantitative research, especially from [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs).

Dijkstra was born in [[Rotterdam]].  His father was a chemist who was president of the Dutch Chemical Society; he taught chemistry at a secondary school and was later its superintendent.  His mother was a mathematician, but never had a formal job.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digidome.nl/edsger_wybe_dijkstra.htm |title=Edsger Wybe Dijkstra |website=Stichting Digidome|date=3 September 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206193322/www.digidome.nl/edsger_wybe_dijkstra.htm |archivedate=6 December 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dijkstra.html| title=Dijkstra biography | last1=O'Connor |first1=J J |last2=Robertson |first2=E F |website=The MacTutor History of Mathematics, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |date=July 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011055811/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dijkstra.html |archivedate=11 October 2013 |deadurl=no}}</ref>  Dijkstra had considered a career in law during his last years in high school. He had hoped to represent the Netherlands in the United Nations. He graduated in 1948 with the highest possible marks in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. So his teachers and parents counseled him to seek a career in the sciences. He decided to join the [[University of Leiden]], to study mathematics and physics during the first years, and [[theoretical physics]] later on.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  In the early 1950s, [[electronic computers]] were a novelty. Dijkstra stumbled on his career quite by accident. His father had seen an advertisement for a three-week course in programming for the electronic computer [[EDSAC]], to be given at [[Cambridge University]], and he advised his son to attend the course. Dijkstra felt that computers might become an important tool for theoretical physicists, and he decided to attend this course in September 1951. When he asked his supervisor, Professor dr. A. Haantjes, for a letter of recommendation, it turned out that Professor Haantjes knew [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], the director of the Computation Department at the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]], and he knew that van Wijngaarden had taken the same course in 1950. Professor Haantjes phoned van Wijngaarden who invited Dijkstra to visit the Mathematical Center and wrote the letter of recommendation. Van Wijngaarden also offered Dijkstra a job, which he accepted, becoming officially the Netherlands’ first “programmer” in March 1952.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  In 1956 he graduated from the [[Leiden University]] in mathematics and theoretical physics. In 1959 he received his PhD from the [[University of Amsterdam]] for his thesis entitled ‘Communication with an Automatic Computer’, devoted to a description of the assembly language designed for the first commercial computer developed in the Netherlands, the X1. It also dealt with the concept of an interrupt, a novelty at that time. His PhD thesis supervisor was van Wijngaarden.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>  For some time Dijkstra remained committed to physics, working on it in [[Leiden]] three days out of each week. With increasing exposure to computing, however, his focus began to shift. As he recalled:<ref name=\"ewd340\">[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html E. W. Dijkstra Archive]</ref> {{quote |After having programmed for some three years, I had a discussion with [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden|A. van Wijngaarden]], who was then my boss at the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]], a discussion for which I shall remain grateful to him as long as I live. The point was that I was supposed to study [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of Leiden]] simultaneously, and as I found the two activities harder and harder to combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become a real, respectable [[theoretical physicist]], or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to become....., yes what? A [[programmer]]? But was that a respectable profession? For after all, what was [[Computer programming|programming]]? Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline? I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues, who, when asked about their professional competence, could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest, whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand empty-handed. Full of misgivings I knocked on van Wijngaarden’s office door, asking him whether I could “speak to him for a moment”; when I left his office a number of hours later, I was another person. For after having listened to my problems patiently, he agreed that up till that moment there was not much of a programming discipline, but then he went on to explain quietly that automatic computers were here to stay, that we were just at the beginning and could not I be one of the persons called to make programming a respectable discipline in the years to come? This was a turning point in my life and I completed my study of physics formally as quickly as I could.|Edsger Dijkstra|The Humble Programmer (EWD340)|[[Communications of the ACM]]}}  When Dijkstra married Maria (Ria) C. Debets in 1957, he was required as a part of the marriage rites to state his profession. He stated that he was a programmer, which was unacceptable to the authorities, there being no such profession at that time in The Netherlands.<ref>[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html E. W. Dijkstra Archive]. “Another two years later, in 1957, I married and Dutch marriage rites require you to state your profession and I stated that I was a programmer. But the municipal authorities of the town of Amsterdam did not accept it on the grounds that there was no such profession. And, believe it or not, but under the heading “profession” my marriage act shows the ridiculous entry “theoretical physicist”!”</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/people/144-dijkstra.html |author=James, Mike |title=''Edsger Dijkstra - The Poetry of Programming'' |publisher=i-programmer.info |date=1 May 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref>  ===Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam=== From 1952 until 1962 Dijkstra worked at the [[Mathematisch Centrum]] in Amsterdam.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> The early computers were built out of vacuum tubes. They occupied large amounts of space, consumed power voraciously, and failed regularly. As Dijkstra recalls, “In retrospect one can only wonder that those first machines worked at all, at least sometimes. The overwhelming problem was to get and keep the machine in working order.”<ref>[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html Edsger W. Dijkstra Archive]</ref>  He worked closely with [[Bram Jan Loopstra]] and [[Carel S. Scholten]], who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of interaction remains a model of disciplined engineering: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers would have to be faithful to their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned from this experience were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/> Dijkstra formulated and solved the [[shortest path problem]] for a demonstration at the official inauguration of the ARMAC computer in 1956, but —because of the absence of journals dedicated to automatic computing— did not publish the result until 1959.  At the Mathematical Center, Dijkstra and his colleague [[J. A. Zonneveld]] developed a [[compiler]] for the programming language [[ALGOL 60]]; it had a profound influence on his later thinking on programming as a scientific activity. He and Zonneveld had completed the implementation of the first [[ALGOL 60]] [[compiler]] by August 1960, more than a year before a compiler was produced by another group.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  ===Eindhoven University of Technology=== In 1962 Dijkstra moved to [[Eindhoven]], where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]. Then in 1964 they moved to a newly built house in [[Nuenen]], a small village on the outskirts of Eindhoven.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>  The university did not have a separate computer science department and the culture of the mathematics department did not particularly suit him. Dijkstra tried to build a group of computer scientists who could collaborate on solving problems. This was an unusual model of research for the Mathematics Department.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  In the late 1960s he built the [[THE multiprogramming system|THE operating system]] (named for the university, then known as [[Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven]]), which has influenced the designs of subsequent [[operating systems]].  ===Burroughs Corporation=== Dijkstra joined [[Burroughs Corporation]] as its Research Fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the company’s research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen. He was already very famous by that time, and he received a large number of invitations to lecture throughout the world. He used these visits to interact with other computer scientists, mentor younger scientists, and sharpen his skills as an English speaker. He also established the Eindhoven Tuesday Afternoon Club (ETAC), a group of researchers who met every Tuesday afternoon in the campus of the university to work on a scientific problem or discuss a recently published paper.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>  The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series (described below), most of them technical reports, for private circulation within a select group.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  ===The University of Texas at Austin=== Dijkstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the Computer Science Department at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1984. He had been visiting the Burroughs Research Center in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] since the late 1970s and had become quite familiar with the Department of Computer Science and its faculty. As he says in an autobiographical note, “...when The University of Texas at Austin offered me the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences, the offer was actually welcome. The offer was not so surprising, nor my acceptance, for I knew Austin, I knew UT and they knew me. All through my years at Burroughs I had made it a rule to visit, wherever I went, the local university and since the late 70s Burroughs had had an Austin Research Center, a visit to which was included in most of my trips to the USA.”<ref>[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD11xx/EWD1166.html Edsger W. Dijkstra Archive]</ref> Dijkstra remained prolific in research during his years at Austin. He had embarked on a long-term project on “Streamlining Mathematical Arguments”.  The years in Austin saw Dijkstra at his best as a teacher and mentor for a generation of students, both undergraduate and graduate. From his days in the Eindhoven University of Technology, he had thought deeply about how computer science should be taught. He had sharpened his thinking on education over a number of years, and Austin provided him the opportunity for trying out his ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://syedirfanhyder.blogspot.com/2013/03/beauty-is-our-business-mathematics-and.html |author=Irfan Hyder, Syed |title=''Learning and Life: Beauty is Our Business - Mathematics, Excellence and the Great Dijkstra'' |publisher=syedirfanhyder.blogspot.com |date=25 March 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://syedirfanhyder.blogspot.com/2013/12/fairness-in-grading-lesson-by-dijkstra.html |author=Irfan Hyder, Syed |title=''Learning and Life: Fairness in Grading: A Lesson by the Great Dijkstra'' |publisher=syedirfanhyder.blogspot.com |date=12 December 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref>  ===Last years=== Dijkstra worked in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] until his retirement  in November 1999.

He said that he wanted to retire in Austin, [[Texas]], but to die in the Netherlands.

Many of his papers are the source of new research areas. Many concepts that are now standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra and/or bear names coined by him. Several important problems were also first formulated and solved by him. A 1994 survey of over a thousand professors of computer science was conducted to obtain a list of 38 most influential scholarly papers in the field, and Dijkstra is the author of five papers.<ref>Laplante, Phillip A. (1996 & 2008)</ref>  During his forty-plus years as a computing scientist, which included positions in both academia and industry, Dijkstra made numerous seminal contributions to many areas of [[computing science]], including [[compiler construction]], [[operating systems]], [[concurrent programming]]/[[concurrent computing]], [[distributed computing]]/[[distributed programming]], [[programming paradigm]] and methodology, [[Programming language theory|programming language]] research, [[Software design|program design]], [[software development|program development]], [[program verification]], [[software engineering]] principles, [[algorithm design]], and philosophical foundations of [[computer science]] and [[computer programming]]. In addition, Dijkstra was intensely interested in [[On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science|teaching computer science]], and in the relationships between academic computing science and the [[software industry]].    ===Algorithmic work=== [[File:Dijkstra Animation.gif|Dijkstra's algorithm runtime|thumb |Dijkstra's algorithm. It picks the unvisited vertex with the lowest-distance, calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the neighbor's distance if smaller. Mark visited (set to red) when done with neighbors.]]  Dijkstra's algorithmic work (especially [[graph algorithms]], [[concurrent algorithm|concurrent algorithms]], and [[distributed algorithms]]) plays an important role in many areas of computing science. According to [[Leslie Lamport]] (2002), Dijkstra “started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]] with his 1965 CACM paper “Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control”, in which he first stated and solved the mutual exclusion problem.” As Lamport explains, “that paper is probably why [[PODC]] exists (...). It remains to this day the most influential paper in the field. That it did not win a [[PODC Influential-Paper Award|PODC Influential Paper Award]] reflects an artificial separation between concurrent and distributed algorithms–a separation that has never existed in Dijkstra’s work.”<ref>[http://www.podc.org/influential/2002-influential-paper/ 2002 PODC Influential Paper Award (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]. The following is a description of the winning paper’s contribution, written by [[Leslie Lamport]]: “Edsger W. Dijkstra started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]] with his 1965 CACM paper “Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control”, in which he first stated and solved the mutual exclusion problem. That paper is probably why PODC exists; it certainly inspired most of my work. It remains to this day the most influential paper in the field.”</ref>   In 1959 Dijkstra published in a 3-page article ‘A note on two problems in connexion with graphs’ the [[algorithm]] to find the shortest path in a graph, now called [[Dijkstra's algorithm]]. Its impact over the next 40 years is summarised from the article of [[Mikkel Thorup]], ‘Undirected Single Source Shortest Paths with Positive Integer Weights in Linear Time’ (1999): “Since 1959, all theoretical developments in SSSP [Single-Source Shortest Paths] for general directed and undirected graphs have been based on Dijkstra’s algorithm.” Dijkstra's algorithm is used in SPF, [[Shortest Path First]], which is used in the routing protocols [[Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] and [[IS-IS]]. Various modifications to Dijkstra’s algorithm have been proposed by many authors using [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] to reduce the run time of [[shortest path search]]. One of the most used heuristic algorithms is the [[A* search algorithm]], the main goal is to reduce the run time by reducing the search space. [[A* search algorithm]] (first described by [[Peter E. Hart|Peter Hart]], [[Nils John Nilsson|Nils Nilsson]] and [[Bertram Raphael]] of [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] in 1968)<ref name=\"nilsson\">{{cite journal  | first = P.

Dijkstra thought about the [[shortest path problem]] when working at the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]] in 1956 as a [[computer programmer|programmer]] to demonstrate capabilities of a new [[computer]] called [[ARMAC]]. His objective was to choose both a problem as well as an answer (that would be produced by computer) that non-computing people could understand. He designed the [[Dijkstra's algorithm|shortest path algorithm]] in about 20 minutes without aid of paper and pen and later implemented it for ARMAC for a slightly simplified transportation map of 64 cities in Netherland (ARMAC was a 6-bit computer and hence could hold 64 cities comfortably).<ref>Frana, Philip L.

It is the algorithm for the shortest path, which I designed in about twenty minutes. One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fiancée, and tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute invention. In fact, it was published in ’59, three years late. The publication is still readable, it is, in fact, quite nice. One of the reasons that it is so nice was that I designed it without pencil and paper. I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without pencil and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable complexities. Eventually that algorithm became, to my great amazement, one of the cornerstones of my fame.”</ref>  A year later, he came across another problem from hardware engineers working on the institute's next computer: minimize the amount of wire needed to connect the pins on the back panel of the machine. As a solution, he re-discovered the algorithm known as [[Prim's algorithm|Prim's]] [[Minimum spanning tree|minimal spanning tree algorithm]]. The [[Prim's algorithm]] was originally developed in 1930 by [[Czech people|Czech]] mathematician [[Vojtěch Jarník]]<ref>{{citation  | last = Jarník | first = V. | author-link = Vojtěch Jarník  | journal = Práce Moravské Přírodovědecké Společnosti  | language = Czech  | pages = 57–63  | title = O jistém problému minimálním  | trans_title = About a certain minimal problem  | url = http://dml.cz/dmlcz/500726  | volume = 6  | year = 1930}}.</ref> and later independently rediscovered and republished by [[Robert C.

The [[algorithm]] was named the \"shunting yard\" algorithm because its operation resembles that of a [[classification yard|railroad shunting yard]]. The shunting-yard algorithm is commonly used to implement [[operator-precedence parser]]s.  In mid-1960s Dijkstra proposed the [[mutual exclusion]] algorithm for n processes (a generalization of [[Dekker's algorithm]]), which was probably the first published [[concurrent algorithm]] and which introduced a new area of algorithmic research. He also identified the [[deadlock]] problem and proposed the [[banker's algorithm]] that [[Deadlock prevention algorithms|prevents deadlock]].  In 1974 Dijkstra presented three [[self-stabilization|self-stabilizing]] algorithms for [[mutual exclusion]] on a ring. Dijkstra's work is considered to be the first to introduce and demonstrate the [[self-stabilization]] concept.<ref>Dolev, Shlomi (2000). ''Self-stabilization''. (MIT Press), p. 16</ref>  In the mid-1970s Dijkstra (together with other authors) introduced two useful abstractions (mutator and collector) to the study of [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]. The mutator abstracts the process that performs the computation, including allocation of a new storage cell. The collector is the process that automatically reclaims garbage. Furthermore this paper gives a formalization of “[[Tracing garbage collection#Tri-color marking|tri-color marking]]” that is basic to incremental garbage collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=4&uid=15 |title=''People Behind Informatics: Dijkstra-Breakthroughs, Glossary (Garbage Collection)'' |publisher=[[University of Klagenfurt]] |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://blog.golang.org/go15gc |author=Hudson, Richard |title=''Go GC: Prioritizing low latency and simplicity'' |publisher= The Go Programming Language Blog |quote= [[Go (programming language)|Go]] is building a [[Garbage collection (computer science)| garbage collection]] (GC) not only for 2015 but for 2025 and beyond: A GC that supports today’s software development and scales along with new software and hardware throughout the next decade. <br/> To create a garbage collector for the next decade, we turned to an algorithm from decades ago.

Scholten]] proposed the [[Dijkstra–Scholten algorithm]] for detecting termination in [[distributed systems]].  In 1981 Dijkstra developed [[smoothsort]], a [[comparison sort|comparison-based]] [[sorting algorithm]] and a variation of [[heapsort]].  ===Compiler construction and programming language research=== Dijkstra was known to be a fan of [[ALGOL|ALGOL 60]], and worked on the team that implemented the first [[compiler]] for that language. He was closely involved in the ALGOL 60 development, realisation and popularisation. As discussed by Peter Naur in the article ‘The European side of the last phase of the development of ALGOL 60’, in the ''Proceedings of the First ACM SIGPLAN Conference on History of Programming Languages'', January 1978, Dijkstra took part in the period 1958–1959 in a number of meetings that culminated in the publication of the report defining the [[ALGOL 60]] language. Dijkstra’s name does not appear in the list of 13 authors of the final report. Apparently, he eventually left the committee because he could not agree with the majority opinions. Still, while at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam), he wrote jointly with [[Jaap Zonneveld]] the first ALGOL 60 compiler. Dijkstra and Zonneveld, who collaborated on the compiler, agreed not to shave until the project was completed; while Zonneveld shaved shortly thereafter, Dijkstra kept his beard for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vanemden.wordpress.com/2008/05/06/i-remember-edsger-dijkstra-1930-2002/ | title=I remember Edsger Dijkstra (1930–2002) | accessdate=22 December 2010 | author=van Emden, Maarten | date=6 May 2008}}</ref> The ALGOL 60 compiler was one of the first to support [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.dijkstrascry.com/node/4 |title=Dijkstra's Rallying Cry for Generalization: the Advent of the Recursive Procedure, late 1950s – early 1960s |last=Daylight |first=E.

Dijkstra's short book ''Primer of Algol 60 Programming'', originally published in 1962, was for several years the standard reference for the language.  ===Programming paradigm and methodology=== [[Computer programming]] in the 1950s to 1960s was not recognized as an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] and unlike mature sciences there were no theoretical concepts or coding systems. Programming as a professional activity was poorly understood in those years. In Dijkstra’s own words:<ref name=\"ewd340\"/> {{quote |What about the poor [[programmer]]? Well, to tell the honest truth: he was hardly noticed. For one thing, the first machines were so bulky that you could hardly move them and besides that, they required such extensive maintenance that it was quite natural that the place where people tried to use the machine was the same laboratory where the machine had been developed. Secondly, his somewhat invisible work was without any glamour: you could show the machine to visitors and that was several orders of magnitude more spectacular than some sheets of coding. But most important of all, the programmer himself had a very modest view of his own work: his work derived all its significance from the existence of that wonderful machine. Because that was a unique machine, he knew only too well that his programs had only local significance and also, because it was patently obvious that this machine would have a limited lifetime, he knew that very little of his work would have a lasting value.}}  In the late 1960s computer programming was in a [[software crisis|state of crisis]]. [[Software crisis]] is a term used in the early days of [[computing science]] for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient [[computer programs]] in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the [[software]], many software problems arose because existing methods were neither sufficient nor up to the mark. The term ‘’software crisis’’ was coined by some attendees at the first [[NATO]] Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at [[Garmisch]], Germany.<ref name=\"Haigh, Thomas 2010\">Haigh, Thomas (2010)</ref><ref name=\"nato\">[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/NATOReports/index.html Report about the NATO Software Engineering Conference dealing with the software crisis]</ref><ref name=\"nato2\">[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1968.PDF Report on a conference sponsored by the NATO SCIENCE COMMITTEE Garmisch, Germany, 7th to 11th October 1968]</ref> [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem: “The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.”<ref name=\"ewd340\"/>  While Dijkstra had programmed extensively in machine code in the 1950s, he came to the conclusion that in high-level languages frequent use of the [[GOTO]] statement was usually symptomatic of poor structure. In 1968 he wrote a private paper \"A Case against the GO TO Statement\",<ref>{{Cite EWD|215|A Case against the GO TO Statement}}</ref> which was then published as a letter in CACM.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dijkstra |first=E. W. |title=Letters to the editor: go to statement considered harmful |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |date=March 1968 |pages=147–148 |issn=0001-0782 |doi=10.1145/362929.362947 }}</ref> Editor [[Niklaus Wirth]] gave this letter the heading \"[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]\", which introduced the phrase \"[[considered harmful]]\" into computing. Dijkstra's thesis was that departures from linear control flow were clearer if allowed only in disciplined higher-level structures such as the [[Conditional (computer programming)|if-then-else]] statement and the [[while loop]].  This methodology was developed into [[structured programming]] movement, the title of his 1972 book, coauthored with [[C.A.R. Hoare]] and [[Ole-Johan Dahl]]. Considered by many as the first significant movement in history of computer programming, structured programming became the new programming orthodoxy during the 1970s.<ref>[[Donald Knuth|Knuth, Donald]] (1974)</ref><ref>Nakagawa, Toru (TRIZ Journal, 2005)</ref>   Dijkstra formulated some of his early ideas about programming as a mathematical discipline starting around the time of publication of his letter (\"[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]\"). He continued to point out that software productivity is closely related to rigor in design, which eliminates software bugs at an early stage. He was particularly impressed by the dimension of the software problem when he attended the famous 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering, which was the first conference devoted to the problem. He became convinced that [[programming methodology]] should become a scientific discipline, and he decided to study how to avoid complexity in software designs.  ===Program design and development (software engineering principles)=== Dijkstra's ideas about [[programming methodology]] helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the professional discipline of [[software engineering]], enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects.<ref>Broy, Manfred; Denert, Ernst (2002)</ref><ref>Henderson, Harry (Facts on File, Inc., 2009)</ref>   Dijkstra sent “Notes on Structured Programming”, later to be one of his seminal works, to a few friends soliciting their comments. This note became a sensation, and major corporations initiated programs based on his ideas to integrate rigorous practices into their programming projects. Dijkstra had advocated certain design principles, which have now become completely accepted in the computer science community: Large systems should be constructed out of many smaller components; each component should be defined only by its interface and not by its implementation; smaller components may be designed following a similar process of decomposition, thus leading to a top-down style of design; the design should start by enumerating the “[[Separation of concerns|separable concerns]]” and by considering each group of concerns independently of the others; and mathematical logic is and must be the basis for software design. This work has had far-reaching impact on all areas of computer science, from teaching of the very first course in programming to the designs of complex software. Mathematical analysis of designs and specifications have become central activities in computer science research.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  [[Separation of concerns]] (SoC), one of the basic principles in [[software engineering]], is a design principle for separating a [[computer program]] into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate [[concern (computer science)|concern]]. The term ''[[separation of concerns]]'' was coined by Dijkstra in his 1974 paper \"On the role of scientific thought\".<ref>{{Cite book   | last = Dijkstra | first = Edsger W | author-link = Edsger W.

It is, that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, all the time knowing that one is occupying oneself only with one of the aspects. We know that a program must be correct and we can study it from that viewpoint only; we also know that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day, so to speak. In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained&nbsp;—on the contrary!— by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called '''\"the separation of concerns\"''', which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by \"focusing one's attention upon some aspect\": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously.}}  ===Operating system=== In the 1960s Dijkstra and his colleagues in [[Eindhoven]] designed and implemented [[THE multiprogramming system|THE]] (standing for ‘[[Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven]]’) [[operating system]], which was organised into clearly identified [[Abstraction layer|layers]].<ref>Brown, Kyle; Craig, Gary; Hester, Greg (2003). ''Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere'', 2nd Edition (IBM Press), p. 5. “Most experienced IT professionals will agree that developing and adhering to a standard architecture is key to the success of large-scale [[software development]]. Computer pioneer Edsger Dijkstra validated this notion when he developed ''[[THE multiprogramming system|THE]]'' operating system in 1968. Since then, layered architectures have proved their viability in technological domains, such as hardware and networking. <br/> Layering has proved itself in the operating system domain; however, the same benefits are available when applied to e-commerce or to thin client–oriented applications. Layered architectures have become essential in supporting the iterative development process by promoting reusability, scalability, and maintainability.”</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.computer.org/web/closer-than-you-might-think/layers-upon-layers |author=Grier, David Alan |title=''Closer Than You Might Think: Layers upon Layers'' |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |quote=We generally trace the idea of building computer systems in layers back to a 1967 paper that the Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra gave to a joint IEEE Computer Society/ACM conference. Prior to this paper, engineers had struggled with the problem of how to organize software. If you look at early examples of programs, and you can find many in the electronic library of the Computer Society, you will find that most code of that era is complicated, difficult to read, hard to modify, and challenging to reuse. In his 1967 paper, Dijkstra described how software could be constructed in layers and gave an example of a simple operating system that used five layers. He admitted that this system might not be a realistic test of his ideas but he argued that the \"larger the project, the more essential the structuring!\"<br/> The idea of using layers to control complexity has become a mainstay of software architecture. We see it in many forms and apply it to many problems. We see it in the hierarchy of classes in object-oriented programming and in the structure of Service-Oriented Architecture. |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref> His 1968 article on this subject provided the foundation for subsequent designs of the operating systems.   Dijkstra organized the design of the system in layers in order to reduce the overall complexity of the software. Though the term ‘architecture’ had not yet been used to describe [[software design]], this was certainly considered the first glimpse of [[software architecture]].<ref>Albin, Stephen T. (Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2003), p. 3</ref> It introduced a number of design principles which have become part of the working vocabulary of every professional programmer: levels of abstraction, programming in layers, the semaphore, and cooperating sequential processes. His original paper on the THE operating system was reprinted in the 25th Anniversary issue of Communications of the ACM, in January 1983. By way of introduction, the Editor-in-Chief says, “This project initiated a long line of research in multilevel systems architecture — a line that continues to the present day because hierarchical modularity is a powerful approach to organizing large systems.”<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  ===Concurrent programming=== [[File:Rail-semaphore-signal-Dave-F.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[semaphore]] ({{lang-nl|seinpaal}}, the term used in Dijkstra's original description<ref>{{Cite EWD|74|Over seinpalen}}</ref>).

As Brinch Hansen notes, 'Dijkstra lays the conceptual foundation for abstract concurrent programming' with that paper.  In 1968 Dijkstra published his seminal paper ‘Cooperating sequential processes’, a 70-page essay that originated the field of [[concurrent programming]].<ref>McCormick, John W.; Singhoff, Frank; Hugues, Jérôme (2011). ''Building Parallel, Embedded, and Real-Time Applications with Ada'' (Cambridge University Press), p. 5. “The notion of the concurrent program as a means for writing parallel programs without regard for the underlying hardware was first introduced by Edsger Dijkstra (1968). Moti Ben-Ari (1982) elegantly summed up Dijkstra’s idea in three sentences: ‘Concurrent programming is the name given to programming notation and techniques for expressing potential parallelism and solving the resulting synchronization and communication problems. Implementation of parallelism is a topic in computer systems (hardware and software) that is essentially independent of concurrent programming. Concurrent programming is important because it provides an abstract setting in which to study parallelism without getting bogged down in the implementation details.’”</ref> He discussed in it the notion of [[mutual exclusion]] ([[mutex]]) and the criteria a satisfactory solution should satisfy. He also redressed the historical perspective left out of his 1965 paper by including the [[Dekker's algorithm|first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem]], for two processes, due to [[Theodorus Dekker]]. Dijkstra subsequently generalized [[Dekker's algorithm|Dekker's solution]] to n processes.<ref>Anderson, J.H.; Kim, Y.-J.; Herman, T. (2003).

[[File:Dining philosophers.png|thumb|180px|Illustration of the dining philosophers problem]] The [[dining philosophers problem]] is an example problem often used in [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] algorithm design to illustrate [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] issues and techniques for resolving them.

Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]. The citation for the prize reads: “The [[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]] is named for Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (1930-2002), a pioneer in the area of distributed computing. His foundational work on concurrency primitives (such as the semaphore), concurrency problems (such as mutual exclusion and deadlock), reasoning about concurrent systems, and self-stabilization comprises one of the most important supports upon which the field of distributed computing is built. No other individual has had a larger influence on research in principles of distributed computing.”</ref><ref>[http://www.eatcs.org/index.php/dijkstra-prize Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing (EATCS International Symposium on Distributed Computing)]</ref> Some of his papers are even considered to be those that established the field. Dijkstra's 1965 paper, ''Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control'' was the first to present the correct solution to the [[mutual exclusion]] problem. [[Leslie Lamport]] writes that this work “started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]]”.<ref>[http://www.podc.org/influential/2002-influential-paper/ 2002 PODC Influential Paper Award (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]</ref>   In particular, his paper \"Self-stabilizing Systems in Spite of Distributed Control\" (1974) started the sub-field of [[self-stabilization]]. Dijkstra's work was not widely noticed until [[Leslie Lamport]]'s invited talk at the ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] in 1983. In his report on Dijkstra's work on [[self-stabilization|self-stabilizing distributed systems]], Lamport regard it to be 'a milestone in work on fault-tolerance' and 'a very fertile field for research'.<ref>Dolev, Shlomi (2000). ''Self-stabilization''. (MIT Press), p. 3</ref>  In the early 1980s he published two small papers on the [[Dijkstra–Scholten algorithm|problem of detecting termination in distributed systems]]. The first one, four pages long, was written with Carel Scholten; the second, three pages long, with Wim Feijen and Netty van Gasteren.  ===Formal specification and verification===  From the 1970s, Dijkstra's chief interest was [[formal verification]]. The prevailing opinion at the time was that one should first write a program and then provide a [[mathematical proof]] of [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]. Dijkstra objected, noting that the resulting proofs are long and cumbersome and give no insight on how the program was developed. An alternative method is ''[[program derivation]]'', to \"develop proof and program hand in hand\". One starts with a mathematical ''specification'' of what a program is supposed to do and applies mathematical transformations to the specification until it is turned into a program that can be executed. The resulting program is then known to be ''correct by construction''. Much of Dijkstra's later work concerns ways to streamline mathematical argument.  In 1976 Dijkstra published a seminal book, ''A Discipline of Programming'', which put forward his method of systematic development of programs together with their correctness proofs. In his exposition he used his ‘[[Guarded Command Language]]’. The language, with its reliance on non-determinism, the adopted [[weakest precondition]] [[Predicate transformer semantics|semantics]] and the proposed development method has had a considerable impact on the field to this day. The [[refinement calculus]], originally proposed by [[Ralph-Johan Back]]<ref>Back,  Ralph-Johan; Wright, Joakim (1998). ''Refinement Calculus A Systematic Introduction (Texts in Computer Science)''. (Springer)</ref> and developed by [[Carroll Morgan (computer scientist)|Carroll Morgan]],<ref>Morgan, Carroll; Vickers, Trevor (1992). ''On the Refinement Calculus''. (Springer)</ref> is an extension of Dijkstra's [[weakest precondition calculus]], where program statements are modeled as [[Predicate transformer semantics|predicate transformers]].<ref>Back,  Ralph-Johan; Wright, Joakim (1998), p. v</ref>  In 1984, to add further support to this approach to programming, he published jointly with Wim Feijen an introductory textbook for first-year students of computer science. The book, first published in Dutch, was entitled ''Een methode van programmeren''. The English edition appeared in 1988 as ''A Method of Programming''.  Then in 1990 Dijkstra published his book ''Predicate Calculus and Program Semantics'' with [[Carel S. Scholten]]. The book was devoted to logical and mathematical analysis of his [[weakest precondition]] [[Predicate transformer semantics|semantics]] with a long prelude concerning [[weakest precondition calculus|predicate calculus]].  ===On the nature of computer science and computer programming=== Dijkstra wrote a large number of essays on the nature of computer science research and education, on its relationship to the industry and society, and even on the manner in which scientific articles should be written and presented.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  In his 1988 paper ''[[On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science]]'', Dijkstra argues that computer programming should be understood as a branch of mathematics, and that the formal provability of a program is a major criterion for correctness.  In a 2001 interview,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL97C8C53ZM |title=Edsger Dijkstra – Discipline in Thought (visit www.catonmat.net for notes) |publisher=Video.google.com |date= |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> he stated a desire for \"elegance\", whereby the correct approach would be to process thoughts mentally, rather than attempt to render them until they are complete. The analogy he made was to contrast the compositional approaches of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].  Many of his opinions on computer science and programming have become widespread. For example, he coined the programming phrase \"two or more, use a for\",{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} alluding to the rule of thumb that when you find yourself processing more than one instance of a data structure, it is time to consider encapsulating that logic inside a loop.   He was the first to make the claim that programming is so inherently complex that, in order to manage it successfully, programmers need to harness every trick and abstraction possible.   Dijkstra was one of the most famous opponents of the engineering view of computing science. Like [[Peter Naur]] and [[Kristen Nygaard]], Dijkstra dislikes the very term 'computer science'. [[Computer science]], as Dijkstra pointed out, deserves a better name. He suggests it can be called 'computing science'. Instead of the computer, or computing technology, Dijkstra wanted to emphasize the abstract mechanisms that computing science uses to master complexity. When expressing the abstract nature of [[computing science]], he wrote,  :A confusion of even longer standing came from the fact that the unprepared included the [[electronic engineers]] that were supposed to design, build and maintain the machines. The job was actually beyond the [[electronic technology]] of the day, and, as a result, the question of how to get and keep the physical equipment more or less in working condition became in the early days the all-overriding concern. As a result, the topic became – primarily in the USA – prematurely known as ‘[[computer science]]’ – which, actually, is like referring to [[surgery]] as ‘knife science’ – and it was firmly implanted in people’s minds that [[computing science]] is about machines and their peripheral equipment. Quod non [Latin: \"Which is not true\"]. We now know that electronic technology has no more to contribute to [[computing]] than the physical equipment. We now know that [[programmable computer]] is no more and no less than an extremely handy device for realizing any conceivable mechanism without changing a single wire, and that the core challenge for computing science is hence a conceptual one, viz., what (abstract) mechanisms we can conceive without getting lost in the complexities of our own making..<ref>{{cite EWD|924|On a cultural gap}}{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=E.W.|title=On a cultural gap|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|year=1986|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48–52|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD924.html|doi=10.1007/bf03023921}}</ref>  In ''The Humble Programmer'' (1972), Dijkstra wrote: “We must not forget that it is not our [computing scientists'] business to make programs, it is our business to design classes of computations that will display a desired behaviour.”  Dijkstra also opposed the inclusion of [[software engineering]] under the umbrella of academic computer science. He wrote that, “As economics is known as \"The Miserable Science\", software engineering should be known as \"The Doomed Discipline\", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory.” And “software engineering has accepted as its charter \"How to program if you cannot.\".” <ref>{{Cite EWD|1036|On the cruelty of really teaching computer science}}</ref>  ==Character and working style== [[File:Edsger Dijkstra 1994.jpg|thumb |Dijkstra at the blackboard during a conference at [[ETH Zurich]] in 1994]] In the world of computer science, Dijkstra is well-known as a “character”. In the preface of his book ''A Discipline of Programming'' (1976) he stated the following: “For the absence of a bibliography I offer neither explanation nor apology.”. In fact, most of his articles and books have no references at all.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref> This approach to references was deplored by some researchers. But Dijkstra chose this way of working to preserve his self-reliance.  As a university professor for much of his life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavor.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/> His approach to teaching was unconventional.<ref>Irfan Hyder, Syed (2013)</ref>His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra's first language. However the pauses also served as a way for him to think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin had little to do with computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref> At the beginning of each [[semester]] he would take a photo of each of the students, in order to memorize their names. He never followed a [[textbook]], with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students’ solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over a whole week. Each student was examined in Dijkstra’s office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  He was also highly original in his way of assessing people’s capacity for a job. When Vladimir Lifschitz came to Austin in 1990 for a job interview, Dijkstra gave him a puzzle. Vladimir solved it and has been working in Austin since then.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref>  Despite having invented much of the technology of software, Dijkstra eschewed the use of computers in his own work for many decades. Even after he succumbed to his UT colleagues’ encouragement and acquired a [[Macintosh]] [[computer]], he used it only for [[e-mail]] and for browsing the [[World Wide Web]].<ref name=\"UTx\">{{Citation | publisher = University of Texas | format = memorial | url = http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2002-2003/memorials/Dijkstra/dijkstra.html | title = In Memoriam Edsger Wybe Dijkstra}}.</ref> Dijkstra never wrote his articles using a computer. He preferred to rely on his [[typewriter]] and later on his Montblanc pen.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref> Dijkstra’s favorite writing instrument was the Montblanc Meisterstück [[fountain pen]]. He repeatedly tried other pens, but none ever displaced the Montblanc.   He had no use for [[word processors]], believing that one should be able to write a letter or article without rough drafts, rewriting, or any significant editing. He would work it all out in his head before putting [[pen]] to paper, and once mentioned that when he was a physics student he would solve his homework problems in his head while walking the streets of [[Leiden]].<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/> Most of Dijkstra's publications were written by him alone. He never had a secretary and took care of all his correspondence alone.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref> When colleagues prepared a Festschrift for his sixtieth birthday, published by [[Springer-Verlag]], he took the trouble to thank each of the 61 contributors separately, in a hand-written letter.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref>  In many of his more humorous essays, Dijkstra described a fictional company of which he served as chairman. The company was called Mathematics, Inc., a company that he imagined having [[commercialized]] the production of mathematical [[theorems]] in the same way that software companies had commercialized the production of computer programs.  He invented a number of activities and challenges of Mathematics Inc. and documented them in several papers in the EWD series. The imaginary company had produced a proof of the [[Riemann Hypothesis]] but then had great difficulties collecting [[royalties]] from mathematicians who had proved results assuming the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof itself was a [[trade secret]].<ref name=\"Cite EWD|475\">{{Cite EWD|475}}</ref> Many of the company's proofs were rushed out the door and then much of the company's effort had to be spent on [[Software maintenance|maintenance]].<ref>{{Cite EWD|539}}</ref> A more successful effort was the Standard Proof for [[Pythagoras' Theorem]], that replaced the more than 100 incompatible existing proofs.<ref>{{Cite EWD |427}}</ref> Dijkstra described Mathematics Inc. as \"the most exciting and most miserable business ever conceived\".<ref name=\"Cite EWD|475\"/> EWD 443 (1974) describes his fictional company as having over 75 percent of the world's market share.<ref>{{Cite EWD|443}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Dijkstra | first = Edsger W | title = Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-387-90652-2 }}</ref>  ==EWDs== Dijkstra was well-known for his habit of carefully composing manuscripts with his [[fountain pen]]. The manuscripts are called EWDs, since Dijkstra numbered them with ''EWD'', his initials, as a prefix. According to Dijkstra himself, the EWDs started when he moved from the Mathematical Centre in [[Amsterdam]] to the Eindhoven University of Technology (then Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven). After going to [[Eindhoven]], Dijkstra experienced a [[writer's block]] for more than a year. Dijkstra distributed photocopies of a new EWD among his colleagues. Many recipients photocopied and forwarded their copies, so the EWDs spread throughout the international computer science community. The topics were computer science and mathematics, and included trip reports, letters, and speeches. These short articles span a period of 40 years. Almost all EWDs appearing after 1972 were hand-written. They are rarely longer than 15 pages and are consecutively numbered. The last one, No. 1318, is from 14 April 2002. Within computer science they are known as the EWD reports, or, simply the EWDs. More than 1300 EWDs have been scanned, with a growing number transcribed to facilitate search, and are available online at the Dijkstra archive of the University of Texas.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = University of Texas | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ | title = Online EWD archive}}.</ref>  ==Lifestyle==  Dijkstra's self-confidence went together with a remarkably modest [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], to the point of being [[:wikt:spartan|spartan]].<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref> His and his wife’s house in [[Nuenen]] is simple, small and unassuming. He did not own a TV, a VCR or a mobile telephone, and did not go to the movies.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R.

Dijkstra - display, [[deadly embrace]], semaphore, go-to-less programming, [[structured programming]]. But his influence on programming is more pervasive than any glossary can possibly indicate. The precious gift that this Turing Award acknowledges is Dijkstra's style: his approach to programming as a high, intellectual challenge; his eloquent insistence and practical demonstration that programs should be composed correctly, not just debugged into [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness]]; and his illuminating perception of problems at the foundations of [[Software design|program design]].

Edsger found his answer to this question early in his life: He decided he would live as an academic scientist, conducting research into a new branch of science, the science of computing. He would lay the foundations that would establish computing as a rigorous scientific discipline; and in his research and in his teaching and in his writing, he would pursue perfection to the exclusion of all other concerns. From these commitments he never deviated, and that is how he has made to his chosen subject of study the greatest contribution that any one person could make in any one lifetime.}}  In March 2003, the following email was sent to the [[distributed computing]] community:<ref>Dale, Nell; Lewis, John (2011).

They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques. Since people are people first, and workers second if at all, one should teach liberal topics first, not vocational topics.  A particular strategy with modern perennialists is to teach scientific reasoning, not facts. They may illustrate the reasoning with original accounts of famous experiments. This gives the students a human side to the science, and shows the reasoning in action. Most importantly, it shows the uncertainty and false steps of real science.  Although perennialism may appear similar to [[educational essentialism|essentialism]], perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based. Both philosophies are typically considered to be [[teacher]]-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as [[educational progressivism|progressivism]]. However, since the teachers associated with perennialism are in a sense the authors of the Western masterpieces themselves, these teachers may be open to student criticism through the associated [[Socratic method]], which, if carried out as true dialogue, is a balance between students, including the teacher promoting the discussion.  ==Secular perennialism== The word perennial in secular perennialism suggests something that lasts an indefinitely long time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. As promoted primarily by [[Robert Hutchins]] and [[Mortimer Adler]], a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings is recommended.  This form of perennialism comprises the [[Humanism|humanist]] and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the [[University of Chicago]], where they still strongly influence the curriculum in the form of the undergraduate Common Core.  Other notable figures in the movement include [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] (who together initiated the [[Great Books]] program at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in Annapolis, Maryland), [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Alexander Meiklejohn]], and Sir [[Richard Livingstone]], an English [[Classicism|classicist]] with an American following.  Secular perennialists espouse the idea that education should focus on the historical development of a continually developing common western base of human knowledge and art, the timeless value of classic thought on central human issues by landmark thinkers, and revolutionary ideas critical to historical western [[paradigm shift]]s or changes in world view. A program of studies which is highly general, nonspecialized, and nonvocational is advocated.<ref>Paul D. Travers and Ronald W. Rebore: ''Foundations of Education, Becoming a Teacher'', Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1990, p. 66</ref> They firmly believe that exposure of all citizens to the development of thought by those most responsible for the evolution of the Western tradition is integral to the survival of the freedoms, human rights and responsibilities inherent to a true Democracy.  Adler states: <blockquote> ... our political democracy depends upon the reconstitution of our schools. Our schools are not turning out young people prepared for the high office and the duties of citizenship in a democratic republic. Our political institutions cannot thrive, they may not even survive, if we do not produce a greater number of thinking citizens, from whom some statesmen of the type we had in the 18th century might eventually emerge. We are, indeed, a nation at risk, and nothing but radical reform of our schools can save us from impending disaster... Whatever the price... the price we will pay for not doing it will be much greater.<ref>Mortimer J. Adler: Reforming [http://radicalacademy.com/adlerreformedu.htm Education — No Quick Fix], ''The Radical Academy''</ref> </blockquote>  Hutchins writes in the same vein: <blockquote> The business of saying ... that people are not capable of achieving a good education is too strongly reminiscent of the opposition of every extension of democracy. This opposition has always rested on the allegation that the people were incapable of exercising the power they demanded. Always the historic statement has been verified: you cannot expect the slave to show the virtues of the free man unless you first set him free. When the slave has been set free, he has, in the passage of time, become indistinguishable from those who have always been free ... There appears to be an innate human tendency to underestimate the capacity of those who do not belong to \"our\" group. Those who do not share our background cannot have our ability. Foreigners, people who are in a different economic status, and the young seem invariably to be regarded as intellectually backward ...<ref name=\"Hutchins\">Robert Maynard Hutchins: ''Great Books: The Foundation of a Liberal Education'', Simon & Schuster, New York, 1954</ref> </blockquote>  As with the [[Educational essentialism|essentialists]], perennialists are educationally conservative in the requirement of a curriculum focused upon fundamental subject areas, but stress that the overall aim should be exposure to history's finest thinkers as models for discovery.  The student should be taught such basic subjects as English, languages, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and fine arts.<ref>George F. Kneller: ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Education'', John Wiley & Sons, 1971</ref> Adler states: \"The three R's, which always signified the formal disciplines, are the essence of liberal or general education.\"<ref>Adler: op. cit., p. 62</ref>  Secular perennialists agree with [[Educational progressivism|progressivists]] that memorization of vast amounts of factual information and a focus on second-hand information in textbooks and lectures does not develop rational thought. They advocate learning through the development of meaningful conceptual thinking and judgement by means of a directed reading list of the profound, aesthetic, and meaningful [[great books]] of the [[Western canon]]. These books, secular perennialists argue, are written by the world's finest thinkers, and cumulatively comprise the \"[[Great Conversation]]\" of mankind with regard to the central human questions. Their basic argument for the use of original works (abridged translations being acceptable as well) is that these are the products of \"[[genius]]\". Hutchins remarks:  <blockquote>Great books are great teachers; they are showing us every day what ordinary people are capable of. These books come out of ignorant, inquiring humanity. They are usually the first announcements for success in learning. Most of them were written for, and addressed to, ordinary people.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/></blockquote>  It is important to note that the Great Conversation is not static, which is the impression that one might obtain from some descriptions of perennialism, a confusion with religious perennialism, or even the term perennialism itself.  The Great Conversation and the set of related great books changes as the representative thought of man changes or progresses, and is therefore representative of an evolution of thought, but is not based upon the whim or fancy of the latest cultural fads.  Hutchins makes this point very clear:  <blockquote> In the course of history... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation. ...the West needs to recapture and reemphasize and bring to bear upon its present problems the wisdom that lies in the works of its greatest thinkers and in the discussion that they have carried on.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  Perennialism was a solution proposed in response to what was considered by many to be a failing educational system. Again Hutchins writes:  <blockquote> The products of American high schools are illiterate; and a degree from a famous college or university is no guarantee that the graduate is in any better case. One of the most remarkable features of American society is that the difference between the \"uneducated\" and the \"educated\" is so slight.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  In this regard [[John Dewey]] and Hutchins were in agreement. Hutchins's book ''The Higher Learning in America'' deplored the \"plight of higher learning\" that had turned away from cultivation of the intellect and toward anti-intellectual practicality due in part, to a lust for money. In a highly negative review of the book, Dewey wrote a series of articles in ''The Social Frontier'' which began by applauding Hutchins' attack on \"the aimlessness of our present educational scheme.<ref>Thomas Erlich: \"Dewey versus Hutchins: The Next Round,\" ''Education and Democracy: Re-imagining Liberal Learning in America'', ed. Robert Orril, College Entrance Examination Board, New York, 1997</ref>  Perennialists believe that reading is to be supplemented with mutual investigations (between the teacher and the student) and minimally-directed discussions through the [[Socratic method]] in order to develop a historically oriented understanding of concepts. They argue that accurate, independent reasoning distinguishes the developed or educated mind and they thus stress the development of this faculty. A skilled teacher would keep discussions on topic and correct errors in reasoning, but it would be the class, not the teacher, who would reach the conclusions.  While not directing or leading the class to a conclusion, the teacher may work to accurately formulate problems within the scope of the texts being studied.  While the standard argument for utilizing a modern text supports distillation of information into a form relevant to modern society, perennialists argue that many of the historical debates and the development of ideas presented by the great books are relevant to any society, at any time, and thus that the suitability of the great books for instructional use is unaffected by their age.  Perennialists freely acknowledge that any particular selection of great books will disagree on many topics; however, they see this as an advantage, rather than a detriment. They believe that the student must learn to recognize such disagreements, which often reflect current debates. The student becomes responsible for thinking about the disagreements and reaching a reasoned, defensible conclusion. This is a major goal of the Socratic discussions. They do not advocate teaching a settled scholarly interpretation of the books, which would cheat the student of the opportunity to learn rational criticism and to know his own mind.  ==Religious perennialism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of education]] --> Perennialism was originally religious in nature, developed first by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the thirteenth century in his work ''[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer11.htm De Magistro]'' (''The Teacher'').  In the nineteenth century, [[John Henry Newman]] presented a detailed defense of educational perennialism in ''The Idea of a University''.  Discourse 5 of that work, \"[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/idea/discourse5.html Knowledge Its Own End]\", is still relevant as a clear statement of a Christian educational perennialism.  There are several epistemological options, which affect the pedagogical options.  The possibilities may be surveyed by considering four extreme positions, as indicated in the following table: {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"25\" cellpadding=\"25\" align=\"center\" |- ! Idealistic Rationalism ! Realistic Rationalism |-  ! Idealistic Fideism ! Realistic Fideism |}  ==Colleges exemplifying this philosophy== * [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] is a well-known secular liberal arts college which requires a year-long humanities course covering ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy.

This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}</ref><ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /><ref name=\"Hyponatremia\" /> * [[Hyperthermia]]<ref name=\"pmid22392347\" /><ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /><ref name=\"Hyponatremia\" /> * [[Bruxism]] (grinding and clenching of the teeth)<ref name=\"current perspectives\" /><ref name=\"pmid22392347\" /><ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /> * Increased wakefulness or [[insomnia]]<ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /> * Increased perspiration and sweating<ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /><ref name=\"Hyponatremia\" /> * Increased [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]]<ref name=\"pmid22392347\" /><ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /><ref name=\"Hyponatremia\" /> {{multicol-break}} * Loss of [[appetite]]<ref name=\"Toxnet MDMA\" /> * Nausea and vomiting<ref name=\"current perspectives\" /> * [[Diarrhea]]<ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /> * [[Erectile dysfunction]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spauwen|first1=L.

At the time, Merck was interested in developing substances that stopped abnormal bleeding. Merck wanted to avoid an existing patent held by [[Bayer]] for one such compound: [[hydrastinine]]. Köllisch developed a preparation of a hydrastinine [[chemical analogue|analogue]], methylhydrastinine, at the request of his coworkers, Walther Beckh and Otto Wolfes. MDMA (called methylsafrylamin, safrylmethylamin or N-Methyl-a-Methylhomopiperonylamin in Merck laboratory reports) was an [[reaction intermediate|intermediate compound]] in the synthesis of methylhydrastinine.

History of MDMA}}</ref> In 1927, Max Oberlin studied the pharmacology of MDMA while searching for substances with effects similar to [[adrenaline]] or [[ephedrine]], the latter being structurally similar to MDMA. Compared to ephedrine, Oberlin observed that it had similar effects on [[vascular smooth muscle]] tissue, stronger effects at the uterus, and no \"local effect at the eye\". MDMA was also found to have effects on [[blood sugar]] levels comparable to high doses of ephedrine. Oberlin concluded that the effects of MDMA were not limited to the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Research was stopped \"particularly due to a strong price increase of safrylmethylamine\", which was still used as an intermediate in methylhydrastinine synthesis. Albert van Schoor performed simple toxicological tests with the drug in 1952, most likely while researching new stimulants or circulatory medications. After pharmacological studies, research on MDMA was not continued. In 1959, Wolfgang Fruhstorfer synthesized MDMA for pharmacological testing while researching stimulants. It is unclear if Fruhstorfer investigated the effects of MDMA in humans.<ref name=\"pmid17152992\"/>  Outside of Merck, other researchers began to investigate MDMA. In 1953 and 1954, the [[United States Army]] commissioned a study of [[toxicity]] and behavioral effects in animals injected with [[mescaline]] and several analogues, including MDMA.

In general, the unlicensed use, sale or manufacture of MDMA are all criminal offences.  In Australia, MDMA was declared illegal in 1986 because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse. It is classed as a [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Schedule 9 Prohibited Substance]] in the country, meaning it is available for scientific research purposes only. Any other type of sale, use or manufacture is strictly prohibited by law. Permits for research uses on humans must be approved by a recognized [[ethics committee]] on human research.  In the United Kingdom, MDMA is illegal under a 1977 modification to the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]<ref name=\"UK legality\"/> thereby making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess the drug without a licence. Penalties include a maximum of seven years and/or unlimited fine for possession; life and/or unlimited fine for production or trafficking.  In the United States, MDMA is currently placed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.<ref>''Schedules of Controlled Substances; Scheduling of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act; Remand'', 53 Fed.

It is the [[flag]] and emblem of the [[European Union]] (EU).<ref>It is termed \"Flag of Europe\" or \"European Flag\" by both organisations, intended to represent the continent as a whole, but has no legal basis beyond use by the CoE. It is also known as the \"flag of the European Union\" excluding its relation to the CoE but the term \"flag of the Council of Europe\" is never used.</ref> It is also often used to indicate [[eurozone]] countries, and, more loosely, to represent the continent of Europe or the countries of Europe independent of any of these institutions. The number of stars does not vary according to the member states as they are intended to represent all the peoples of Europe, even those outside the EU.<ref>{{citation|title=EUROPA – The EU at a glance – The symbols of the European Union – The European Flag|accessdate=24 December 2011|url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/emblem/index_en.htm}}</ref>  The flag was designed in  1955 for the [[Council of Europe]] as its symbol, and the CoE urged it to be adopted by other organisations. In 1985 the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), adopted it as its own flag (having had no flag of its own before) at the initiative of the [[European Parliament]].  The flag is not mentioned in the [[Treaties of the European Union|EU's treaties]], its incorporation being dropped along with the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], but it is formally adopted in law. In order to avoid confusion with the European Union, the Council of Europe uses a modified version with a lower-case \"e\" in the centre of the stars which is referred to as the \"Council of Europe Logo\".  Since its adoption by the European Union it has become more associated with the EU due to the EU's higher profile and heavy usage of the emblem. The flag has also been used to represent Europe in [[sporting event]]s and as a pro-democracy banner outside the Union.<ref name=\"Mite\">{{citation|last=Mite|firstvalentinas=|title=Belarus: Scores Arrested, Opposition Leader Hospitalized After Minsk Protests|date=20 October 2004|publisher=rferl.org|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/10/340afaf0-ebf7-4a03-8a25-ebda21070598.html|accessdate=5 August 2007}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7992259.stm Romania slams Moldova's sanctions]</ref> It has partly inspired other flags, such as those of other European organisations and those of states where the EU has been heavily involved (such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo]]).  == History == <div class=\"floatright\"> <timeline> ImageSize  = width:320 height:430 PlotArea   = left:50 right:0 bottom:10 top:10 DateFormat = yyyy Period     = from:1950 till:1986 TimeAxis   = orientation:vertical  ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1950 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1950  PlotData=   Color:yellow mark:(line,black) align:left fontsize:M    shift:(0,-3) # shift text to right side of bar    # there is no automatic collision detection, fontsize:XS    # so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap shift:(25,-10)    at:1950 shift:15,-6 text: Committee established   at:1955 shift:15,-6 text: Adoption by the Council of Europe   at:1958 shift:15,-6 text: Promotion at the Brussels Expo   at:1979 shift:15,-6 text: European Parliament requests a symbol   at:1983 shift:15,-6 text: Adoption by the European Parliament   at:1985 shift:15,-6 text: Approval by the European Council   at:1986 shift:15,-6 text: Adoption by the European Communities </timeline> </div>  === Creation === The search for a symbol began in 1950 when a committee was set up in order to look into the question of a European flag.

The national [[flag of Cape Verde]] also shows similarity to the flag of the European Union. The flag is made of a circular formation of ten yellow stars on a dark blue background and a band of white and red.  The stars represent the main islands of the nation (a chain of islands off the coast of West Africa). The blue represents the ocean and the sky. The band of white and red represents the road toward the construction of the nation, and the colours stand for peace (white) and effort (red).  The flag was adopted on 22 September 1992.  Other labels take reference to the European flag such as the [[Organic certification#Europe|EU organic food label]] that uses the twelve stars but reorders them into the shape of a leaf on a green background.

G. Levy and the recent reconstruction by Susan Hood, crediting Arsène Heitz with the original design still seems to me the soundest option.  In particular, Arsène Heitz himself, in 1987, laid claim to his own role in designing the flag and to its religious inspiration when he said that 'the flag of Europe is the flag of Our Lady' [''Magnificat'' magazine, 1987] Secondly, it is worth noting the testimony of  Father Pierre Caillon, who refers to a meeting with Arsène Heitz. Caillon tells of having met the former Council of Europe employee by chance in August 1987 at Lisieux in front of the Carmelite monastery. It was Heitz who stopped him and declared 'I was the one who designed the European flag. I suddenly had the idea of putting the 12 stars of the Miraculous Medal of the Rue du Bac on a blue field.

Heitz also made a connection to the date of the flag's adoption, 8 December 1955, coinciding  with the Catholic [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].  [[Paul M. G.

To the question \"Who really designed the flag?\" Lévy replied: :\"I did, and I calculated the proportions to be used for the geometric design. Arsène Heitz, who was an employee in the mail service, put in all sorts of proposals, including the 15-star design. But he submitted too many designs. He wanted to do the European currencies with 15 stars in the corner. He wanted to do national flags incorporating the Council of Europe flag.\"<ref name=\"Gialdino\"/> Carlo Curti Gialdino (2005) has reconstructed  the design process to the effect that Heitz's proposal contained varying numbers of stars, from which the version with twelve stars was chosen by the Committee of Ministers meeting at Deputy level in January 1955 as one out of two remaining candidate designs.<ref name=\"Gialdino\"/>  Lévy's 1998 interview apparently gave rise to a new variant of the \"Marian\" anecdote.

The [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]] officially announced the European Anthem on 19 January 1972 at Strasbourg: the prelude to \"The Ode to Joy\", 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th symphony. In 1974 the same piece of music was adopted as the [[National Anthem of Rhodesia]].  Conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] was asked to write three instrumental arrangements – for solo piano, for wind instruments and for symphony orchestra and he conducted the performance used to make the official recording. He wrote his decisions on the score, notably those concerning the tempo. Karajan decided on [[Half note|minim]] (half note) = 80 whereas Beethoven had written [[Quarter note|crotchet]] (quarter note) = 120.  The anthem was launched via a major information campaign on [[Europe Day]] in 1972. In 1985, it was adopted by EU heads of State and government as the official anthem of the then European Community – since 1993 the European Union. It is not intended to replace the national anthems of the Member States but rather to celebrate the values they all share and their unity in diversity.

Aside from this, several translations of the poem used by Beethoven as well as original works have attempted to provide lyrics to the anthem in various languages. Versions of the anthem including lyrics have been sung outside official EU occasions.  In France, several adaptations of Beethoven's Ode were known long before the onset of European Union. A version by the librettist Maurice Bouchor (1855–1929) entitled ''Hymn to the Universal Humanity'' (''[[:s:fr:Hymne à l'universelle humanité|Hymne à l'universelle humanité]]'') adding several verses to a preceding version of Jean Ruault, was published.

[[Hans Eysenck|H. J. Eysenck]]'s ''Encyclopedia of Psychology'' identifies him as the founder of modern scientific [[psychiatry]], as well as of [[psychopharmacology]] and [[psychiatric genetics]]. Kraepelin believed the chief origin of psychiatric [[disease]] to be [[biological process|biological]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] malfunction. His theories dominated psychiatry at the start of the 20th century and, despite the later [[psychodynamic]] influence of [[Sigmund Freud]] and his disciples, enjoyed a revival at century's end.  == Family and early life == Kraepelin, whose father was a former opera singer, music teacher, and later successful story teller,<ref>Peter Barham (2004), ''Forgotten Lunatics of the Great War'' (New Haven: Yale) p. 163 n. 47.</ref> was born in 1856 in [[Neustrelitz]], in the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] in [[Germany]].  He was first introduced to biology by his brother Karl, 10 years older and, later, the director of the Zoological Museum of Hamburg.<ref>On Kraepelin's early life and family, see Burgmair et al., vol. I, as well as his ''Memoirs'' (Berlin: Springer, 1987).</ref>  ==Career== [[File:Kraepelin.JPG|thumb|Grave in Heidelberg (2008)]] Kraepelin began his medical studies at 18 at the [[University of Leipzig]] and completed them at the [[University of Würzburg]]. At [[Leipzig]], he studied neuropathology under [[Paul Flechsig]] and experimental psychology with [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. Kraepelin would be a disciple of Wundt and had a lifelong interest in [[experimental psychology]] based on his theories. While there, Kraepelin wrote a prize-winning essay, \"The Influence of Acute Illness in the Causation of Mental Disorders\", and at Würzburg he received his MD in 1878. In 1879, he went to work with [[Bernhard von Gudden]] at the University of Munich, where he completed his habilitation thesis, \"The Place of Psychology in Psychiatry\". Returning to the University of Leipzig in 1882, he worked in [[Wilhelm Heinrich Erb]]'s neurology clinic and in Wundt's psychopharmacology laboratory.<ref name=Alic2001>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Emil_Kraepelin.aspx#2 Kraepelin, Emil (1856–1926)] by Margaret Alic, Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology, 2001.</ref>  Kraepelin's major work, ''Compendium der Psychiatrie: Zum Gebrauche für Studirende und Aertze'' (''Compendium of Psychiatry: For the Use of Students and Physicians''), was first published in 1883 and was expanded in subsequent multivolume editions to ''Ein Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie'' (''A Texbook: Foundations of Psychiatry and Neuroscience''). In it, he argued that psychiatry was a branch of medical science and should be investigated by observation and experimentation like the other natural sciences. He called for research into the physical causes of mental illness, and started to establish the foundations of the modern classification system for mental disorders. Kraepelin proposed that by studying case histories and identifying specific disorders, the progression of mental illness could be predicted, after taking into account individual differences in personality and patient age at the onset of disease.<ref name=Alic2001/>  In 1884 he became senior physician in the Prussian provincial town of [[Leubus]] and the following year he was appointed director of the Treatment and Nursing Institute in [[Dresden]]. In 1886, at the age of 30, Kraepelin was named Professor of Psychiatry at the [[University of Dorpat]] (today the [[University of Tartu]]) in what is today [[Estonia]] (see Burgmair et al., vol. IV). Four years later, he became department head at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he remained until 1904.<ref name=Alic2001/> While at Dorpat he became the director of the 80-bed [[Tartu University Clinic|University Clinic]]. There he began to study and record many clinical histories in detail and \"was led to consider the importance of the course of the illness with regard to the classification of mental disorders\".  In 1903 Kraepelin moved to Munich to become Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the [[University of Munich]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1908.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  In 1912 at the request of the [[German Society of Psychiatry]], he began plans to establish a centre for research. Following a large donation from the Jewish German-American [[banker]] [[James Loeb]], who had at one time been a patient, and promises of support from \"patrons of science\", the [[Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry|German Institute for Psychiatric Research]] was founded in 1917 in Munich.<ref>[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/loeb/founder.html James Loeb] Harvard University Press.</ref> Initially housed in existing hospital buildings, it was maintained by further donations from Loeb and his relatives. In 1924 it came under the auspices of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science]]. The German American [[Rockefeller family]]'s [[Rockefeller Foundation]] made a large donation enabling the development of a new dedicated building for the institute, along Kraepelin's guidelines, which was officially opened in 1928.<ref name=Alic2001/>  Kraepelin spoke out against the barbarous treatment that was prevalent in the psychiatric asylums of the time, and crusaded against alcohol, capital punishment and the imprisonment rather than treatment of the insane. He rejected psychoanalytical theories that posited innate or early sexuality as the cause of mental illness, and he rejected philosophical speculation as unscientific. He focused on collecting clinical data and was particularly interested in [[neuropathology]] (e.g., diseased tissue).<ref name=Alic2001/>  In the later period of his career, as a convinced champion of [[social Darwinism]], he actively promoted a policy and research agenda in [[racial hygiene]] and [[eugenics]].<ref name=Engstrom2006>{{cite journal|author=Engstrom EJ, Weber MM, Burgmair W|title=Emil Wilhelm Magnus Georg Kraepelin (1856-1926)|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=97097|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=October 2006|volume=163|issue=10|pages=1710|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.10.1710|pmid=17012678}}.</ref>  Kraepelin retired from teaching at the age of 66, spending his remaining years establishing the Institute. The ninth and final edition of his ''Textbook'' was published in 1927, shortly after his death. It comprised four volumes and was ten times larger than the first edition of 1883.<ref name=Alic2001/>  == Theories and classification schemes == Kraepelin announced that he had found a new way of looking at mental illness, referring to the traditional view as \"symptomatic\" and to his view as \"clinical\". This turned out to be his paradigm-setting synthesis of the hundreds of mental disorders classified by the 19th century, grouping diseases together based on classification of [[syndrome]]—common ''patterns'' of symptoms over time—rather than by simple similarity of major symptoms in the manner of his predecessors. Kraepelin described his work in the 5th edition of his textbook as a \"decisive step from a symptomatic to a clinical view of insanity. . . . The importance of external clinical signs has . . . been subordinated to consideration of the conditions of origin, the course, and the terminus which result from individual disorders. Thus, all purely symptomatic categories have disappeared from the nosology\".<ref name=decker/>  === Psychosis and mood === Kraepelin is specifically credited with the classification of what was previously considered to be a [[Unitary psychosis|unitary concept of psychosis]], into two distinct forms (known as the [[Kraepelinian dichotomy]]):  * [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]] (now seen as comprising a range of mood disorders such as [[clinical depression|recurrent major depression]] and [[bipolar disorder]]), and * [[dementia praecox]].  Drawing on his long-term research, and using the criteria of course, outcome and prognosis, he developed the concept of [[dementia praecox]], which he defined as the \"sub-acute development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at a youthful age\".  When he first introduced this concept as a diagnostic entity in the fourth German edition of his ''Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie'' in 1893, it was placed among the degenerative disorders alongside, but separate from, [[catatonia]] and [[dementia paranoides]]. At that time, the concept corresponded by and large with [[Ewald Hecker]]'s [[hebephrenia]]. In the sixth edition of the ''Lehrbuch'' in 1899 all three of these clinical types are treated as different expressions of one disease, dementia praecox.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yuhas|first=Daisy|title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Has Remained a Challenge (Timeline)|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge|publisher=Scientific American Mind (March 2013)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}.</ref>  One of the cardinal principles of his method was the recognition that any given symptom may appear in virtually any one of these disorders; e.g., there is almost no single symptom occurring in dementia praecox which cannot sometimes be found in manic depression. What distinguishes each disease symptomatically (as opposed to the underlying pathology) is not any particular (pathognomonic) symptom or symptoms, but a specific pattern of symptoms. In the absence of a direct physiological or genetic test or marker for each disease, it is only possible to distinguish them by their specific pattern of symptoms. Thus, Kraepelin's system is a method for pattern recognition, not grouping by common symptoms.  Kraepelin also demonstrated specific patterns in the genetics of these disorders and specific and characteristic patterns in their course and outcome.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Generally speaking, there tend to be more schizophrenics among the relatives of schizophrenic patients than in the general population, while manic depression is more frequent in the relatives of manic depressives. Though, of course, this does not demonstrate genetic linkage, as this might be a socio-environmental factor as well.  He also reported a pattern to the course and outcome of these conditions. Kraepelin believed that schizophrenia had a deteriorating course in which mental function continuously (although perhaps erratically) declines, while manic-depressive patients experienced a course of illness which was intermittent, where patients were relatively symptom-free during the intervals which separate acute episodes. This led Kraepelin to name what we now know as schizophrenia, dementia praecox (the [[dementia]] part signifying the irreversible mental decline). It later became clear that dementia praecox did not necessarily lead to mental decline and was thus renamed [[schizophrenia]] by [[Eugen Bleuler]] to correct Kraepelin's misnomer.  In addition, as Kraepelin accepted in 1920, \"It is becoming increasingly obvious that we cannot satisfactorily distinguish these two diseases\"; however, he maintained that \"On the one hand we find those patients with irreversible dementia and severe cortical lesions. On the other are those patients whose personality remains intact\".<ref>Berrios, GE, Luque, R, Villagran, JM (2003). [http://www.ijpsy.com/volumen3/num2/60/schizophrenia-a-conceptual-history-esquizofrenia-EN.pdf Schizophrenia: a conceptual history]. ''International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy'' 3, no. 2: 111–140.</ref> Nevertheless, overlap between the diagnoses and neurological abnormalities (when found) have continued, and in fact a diagnostic category of [[schizoaffective disorder]] would be brought in to cover the intermediate cases.  Kraepelin devoted very few pages to his speculations about the etiology of his two major insanities, dementia praecox and manic-depressive insanity. However, from 1896 to his death in 1926 he held to the speculation that these insanities (particularly dementia praecox) would one day probably be found to be caused by a gradual systemic or \"whole body\" disease process, probably metabolic, which affected many of the organs and nerves in the body but affected the brain in a final, decisive cascade.<ref>{{cite web|last=Noll|first=Richard|title=Whole Body Madness|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/2104852|publisher=Psychiatric Times|accessdate=26 September 2012}}.</ref>  === Psychopathic personalities === In the first through sixth edition of Kraepelin's influential psychiatry textbook, there was a section on [[moral insanity]], which meant then a disorder of the emotions or moral sense without apparent delusions or hallucinations, and which Kraepelin defined as \"lack or weakness of those sentiments which counter the ruthless satisfaction of egotism\". He attributed this mainly to degeneration. This has been described as a psychiatric redefinition of [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s theories of the \"born criminal\", conceptualised as a \"[[moral]] defect\", though Kraepelin stressed it was not yet possible to recognise them by physical characteristics.<ref name=Wetzell2000>Richard F. Wetzell (2000) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iGW7QLJmuwoC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Inventing the criminal: a history of German criminology, 1880-1945] from p 59 & 146, misc.</ref>  In fact from 1904 Kraepelin changed the section heading to \"The born criminal\", moving it from under \"Congenital feeble-mindedness\" to a new chapter on \"Psychopathic personalities\". They were treated under a theory of degeneration. Four types were distinguished: born criminals (inborn delinquents), [[pathological liars]], [[querulous]] persons, and Triebmenschen (persons driven by a basic compulsion, including [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], [[spendthrifts]], and [[dipsomaniacs]]). The concept of \"[[psychopathic]] inferiorities\" had been recently popularised in Germany by [[Julius Ludwig August Koch]], who proposed congenital and acquired types. Kraepelin had no evidence or explanation suggesting a congenital cause, and his assumption therefore appears to have been simple \"[[biologism]]\". Others, such as [[Gustav Aschaffenburg]], argued for a varying combination of causes. Kraepelin's assumption of a moral defect rather than a positive drive towards crime has also been questioned, as it implies that the moral sense is somehow inborn and unvarying, yet it was known to vary by time and place, and Kraepelin never considered that the moral sense might just be different. [[Kurt Schneider]] criticized Kraepelin's nosology for appearing to be a list of behaviors that he considered undesirable, rather than medical conditions, though Schneider's alternative version has also been criticised on the same basis. Nevertheless, many essentials of these diagnostic systems were introduced into the diagnostic systems, and remarkable similarities remain in the DSM-IV and ICD-10.<ref name=Wetzell2000/> The issues would today mainly be considered under the category of [[personality disorders]], or in terms of Kraepelin's focus on [[psychopathy]].  Kraepelin had referred to psychopathic conditions (or \"states\") in his 1896 edition, including compulsive insanity, impulsive insanity, [[homosexuality]], and mood disturbances. From 1904, however, he instead termed those \"original disease conditions, and introduced the new alternative category of psychopathic personalities. In the eighth edition from 1909 that category would include, in addition to a separate \"dissocial\" type, the excitable, the unstable, the Triebmenschen driven persons, eccentrics, the liars and swindlers, and the quarrelsome. It has been described as remarkable that Kraepelin now considered mood disturbances to be not part of the same category, but only attenuated (more mild) phases of manic depressive illness; this corresponds to current classification schemes.<ref>Henning Sass & Alan Felthous (2008) Chapter 1: History and Conceptual Development of Psychopathic Disorders in [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8WhcGo-1MkYC&dq=kurt+schneider+psychopaths&source=gbs_navlinks_s International Handbook on Psychopathic Disorders and the Law]. Edited by Alan Felthous, Henning Sass.</ref>  === Alzheimer's disease === Kraepelin postulated that there is a specific brain or other biological pathology underlying each of the major psychiatric disorders.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As a colleague of [[Alois Alzheimer]], he was a co-discoverer of [[Alzheimer's disease]], and his laboratory discovered its pathological basis. Kraepelin was confident that it would someday be possible to identify the pathological basis of each of the major psychiatric disorders.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  === Degeneration of the race === Upon moving to become Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the [[University of Munich]] in 1903, Kraepelin increasingly wrote on social policy issues. He was a strong and influential proponent of [[eugenics]] and [[racial hygiene]]. His publications included a focus on [[alcoholism]], [[crime]], [[degeneration]] and [[hysteria]].<ref name=Engstrom2007>{{cite journal|last=Engstrom|first=E. J.|title=On the Question of Degeneration' by Emil Kraepelin (1908)1|journal=[[History of Psychiatry (journal)|History of Psychiatry]]|date=1 September 2007|volume=18|issue=3|pages=389–398|doi=10.1177/0957154X07079689|pmid=18175639|url=http://134.76.163.171:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/10898/1/PEER_stage2_10.1177%252F0957154X07079689.pdf}}.</ref> Kraepelin was convinced that such institutions as the [[education system]] and the [[welfare state]], because of their trend to break the processes of [[natural selection]], undermined the Germans’ biological \"struggle for survival\".<ref name=Engstrom2006/> He was concerned to preserve and enhance the German people, the [[Volk]], in the sense of nation or race. He appears to have held [[Lamarckian]] concepts of evolution, such that cultural deterioration could be inherited. He was a strong ally and promoter of the work of fellow psychiatrist (and pupil and later successor as director of the clinic) [[Ernst Rudin]] to clarify the mechanisms of genetic inheritance as to make a so-called \"[[empirical]] genetic [[prognosis]]\".<ref name=Engstrom2007/>  Martin Brune has pointed out that Kraepelin and Rudin also appear to have been ardent advocates of a [[self-domestication]] theory, a version of [[social Darwinism]] which held that modern culture was not allowing people to be weeded out, resulting in more mental disorder and deterioration of the gene pool. Kraepelin saw a number of \"symptoms\" of this, such as \"weakening of viability and resistance, decreasing fertility, proletarianisation, and moral damage due to \"penning up people\" [''Zusammenpferchung'']. He also wrote that \"the number of idiots, epileptics, psychopaths, criminals, prostitutes, and tramps who descend from alcoholic and syphilitic parents, and who transfer their inferiority to their offspring, is incalculable\". He felt that \"the well-known example of the [[Jews]], with their strong disposition towards nervous and mental disorders, teaches us that their extraordinarily advanced domestication may eventually imprint clear marks on the race\". Brune states that Kraepelin's [[nosological]] system was \"to a great deal, built on the degeneration [[paradigm]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brüne|first=Martin|title=On human self-domestication, psychiatry, and eugenics|journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine|date=1 January 2007|volume=2|issue=1|pages=21|doi=10.1186/1747-5341-2-21|pmid=17919321|pmc=2082022|url=http://www.peh-med.com/content/2/1/21}}</ref>  == Influence == Kraepelin's great contribution in classifying schizophrenia and manic depression remains relatively unknown to the general public, and his work, which had neither the literary quality nor paradigmatic power of Freud's, is little read outside scholarly circles. Kraepelin's contributions were also to a large extent marginalized throughout a good part of the 20th century during the success of Freudian etiological theories. However, his views now dominate many quarters of psychiatric research and academic psychiatry. His fundamental theories on the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders form the basis of the major diagnostic systems in use today, especially the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSM-IV]] and the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD]] system, based on the [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] and earlier [[Feighner Criteria]] developed by espoused \"neo-Kraepelinians\", though [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] and others in the DSM committees were keen not to include assumptions about causation as Kraepelin had.<ref name=decker>[http://peer.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/57/08/96/PDF/PEER_stage2_10.1177%252F0957154X07078976.pdf Hannah S Decker, How Kraepelinian was Kraepelin?

In this role he took in clinical information from a wide range of sources and networks. Despite proclaiming high clinical standards for himself to gather information \"by means of expert analysis of individual cases\", he would also draw on the reported observations of officials not trained in psychiatry. The various editions of his textbooks do not contain detailed case histories of individuals, however, but mosaiclike compilations of typical statements and behaviors from patients with a specific diagnosis.

         "{{Progressivism}}  '''Progressive education''' is a [[pedagogical]] movement that began in the late nineteenth century; it has persisted in various forms to the present. The term ''progressive'' was engaged to distinguish this education from the traditional Euro-American [[curricula]] of the 19th century, which was rooted in classical preparation for the [[university]] and strongly differentiated by [[social class]]. By contrast, progressive education finds its roots in present [[experience]].   Most progressive education programs have these qualities in common: {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}  * Emphasis on learning by doing – hands-on projects, expeditionary learning, [[experiential learning]] * Integrated curriculum focused on thematic units * Integration of [[entrepreneurship]] into education * Strong emphasis on [[problem solving]] and [[critical thinking]] * Group work and development of social skills * Understanding and action as the goals of learning as opposed to rote knowledge * Collaborative and [[cooperative learning]] projects * Education for [[social responsibility]] and [[democracy]] * Highly personalized education accounting for each individual's personal goals * Integration of community service and service learning projects into the daily curriculum * Selection of subject content by looking forward to ask what skills will be needed in future society * De-emphasis on textbooks in favor of varied learning resources * Emphasis on [[lifelong learning]] and social skills * Assessment by evaluation of child’s projects and productions  ==Educational theory== Progressive education can be traced back to the works of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by theorists such as Dewey. Locke believed that \"truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas\".<ref name=\"Hayes\">{{cite book |title=The progressive education movement: Is it still a factor in today's schools? |first=William |last=Hayes |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Education |year=2006}} </ref>{{rp|2}} He further discussed the need for children to have concrete experiences in order to learn. Rousseau deepened this line of thinking in [[Emile, or On Education]], where he argued that subordination of students to teachers and memorization of facts would not lead to an education.  ===Johann Bernhard Basedow=== In Germany, [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]] (1724-1790) established the Philanthropinum at [[Dessau]] in 1774. He developed new teaching methods based on conversation and play with the child, and a program of physical development. Such was his success that he wrote a treatise on his methods, \"On the best and hitherto unknown method of teaching children of noblemen\".  ===Christian Gotthilf Salzmann=== [[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann]] (1744–1811) was the founder of the [[Schnepfenthal institution]], a school dedicated to new modes of education (derived heavily from the ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]). He wrote ''Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children'', one of the first books translated into English by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].  ===Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi=== [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (1746–1827) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[pedagogue]] and educational reformer who exemplified [[Romanticism]] in his approach. He founded several educational institutions both in German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was \"Learning by head, hand and heart\". His research and theories closely resemble those outlined by Rousseau in Emile. He is further considered by many to be the “father of modern educational science”<ref name=\"Hayes\"/> His psychological theories pertain to education as they focus on the development of object teaching, that is, he felt that individuals best learned through experiences and through a direct manipulation and experience of objects. He further speculated that children learn through their own internal motivation rather than through compulsion. (See Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic motivation). A teacher's task will be to help guide their students as individuals through their learning and allow it to unfold naturally.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Education in American Culture |first1=R Freeman |last1=Butts |first2=Lawrence |last2=Cremin |year=1958 }}</ref>  ===Friedrich Fröbel=== [[Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]] (1782 – 1852) was a student of Pestalozzi who laid the foundation for modern [[education]] based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities. He believed in “self-activity” and play as essential factors in child education. The teacher’s role was not to indoctrinate but to encourage self-expression through play, both individually and in group activities. He created the concept of [[kindergarten]].  ===Johann Friedrich Herbart=== [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] (1776–1841) emphasized the connection between individual development and the resulting societal contribution. The five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were Inner Freedom, Perfection, Benevolence, Justice, and Equity or Recompense.<ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Blyth |first=A. |year=1981 |title=From individuality to character: the Herbartian sociology applied to education| journal=British Journal of Educational Studies|volume=29 |number=1 |pages=69–79 |accessdate=September 7, 2007 |doi=10.2307/3120425}}</ref> According to Herbart, abilities were not innate but could be instilled, so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development.  In order to develop a child to lead to a consciousness of social responsibility, Herbart advocated that teachers utilize a methodology with five formal steps: “Using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of interest to the children, presented that topic, and questioned them inductively, so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known, looked back, and deductively summed up the lesson’s achievements, then related them to moral precepts for daily living”.<ref>{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Miller |first=E.J. |year=2003|title=Teaching methods, the Herbartian revolution and Douglas Clay Ridgley at Illinois State Normal University |journal=Journal of Geography|volume=102 |accessdate= September 7, 2007|page=114 |doi=10.1080/00221340308978532}}</ref>  ===John Melchior Bosco=== [[Don Bosco|John Melchior Bosco]] (1815 – 1888) was concerned about the education of street children who had left their villages to find work in the rapidly industrialized city of [[Turin]], Italy. Exploited as cheap labor or imprisoned for unruly behavior, Bosco saw the need of creating a space where they would feel at home. He called it an 'Oratory' where they could play, share friendships and develop their creative talents. He taught them various skills for gainful self-employment. With those who had found work, he set up a mutual-fund society (an early version of the [[Grameen Bank]]) to teach them the benefits of saving and self-reliance. The principles underlying his educational method that won over the hearts and minds of thousands of youth who flocked to his oratory were: 'be reasonable', 'be kind', 'believe' and 'be generous in service'. Today his method of education is practiced in nearly 3000 institutions set up around the world by the members of the [[Salesian Society]] he founded in 1873.  ===Cecil Reddie=== While studying for his doctorate in [[Göttingen]] in 1882-1883, [[Cecil Reddie]] was greatly impressed by the progressive educational theories being applied there.  Reddie founded [[Abbotsholme School]] in [[Derbyshire]], [[England]] in 1889. Its curriculum enacted the ideas of progressive education. Reddie rejected rote learning, classical languages and corporal punishment. He combined studies in modern languages and the sciences and arts with a program of physical exercise, manual labour, recreation, crafts and arts. Abbotsholme was imitated throughout Europe and was particularly influential in Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/494634/Cecil-Reddie |title=Encycolpedia Britannica |accessdate=10 October 2013 }}</ref> He often engaged foreign teachers, who learned its practices, before returning home to start their own schools. [[Hermann Lietz]] an Abbotsholme teacher founded five schools (Landerziehungsheime für Jungen) on Abbotsholme's principles.<ref name=\"ONDB\">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Searby |title= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 }}</ref> Other people he influenced included [[Kurt Hahn]], [[Adolphe Ferrière]] and [[Edmond Demolins]]. His ideas also reached Japan, where it turned into “Taisho-era Free Education Movement” (Taisho Jiyu Kyoiku Undo)  ===John Dewey=== In the United States the \"Progressive Education Movement\", starting in the 1880s and lasting for sixty years, helped boost American public schools from a budding idea to the regular norm. John Dewey, a principal figure in this movement from the 1880s to 1904, set the tone for educational philosophy as well as concrete school reforms. His thinking had been influenced by the ideas of Fröbel and Herbart.<ref>{{cite book |title=Froebel's Educational Principles |first=John |last=Dewey |chapter=5 |publisher=University of Chicago |year= 1915 |pages=111–127 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Development of Education in the Twentieth Century |first=Adolphe Erich |last=Meyer |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1939 }}</ref> His reactions to the prevailing theories and practices in education, corrections made to these philosophies, and recommendations to teachers and administrators to embrace “the new education,” provide a vital account of the history of the development of educational thinking in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Dewey placed so called pragmatism above moral absolutes and helped give rise to situational ethics.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Public Education|url=http://www.hyperhistory.net/apwh/essays/cot/t0w20education.htm}}</ref> Beginning in 1897 [[John Dewey]] published a summary of his theory on progressive education in School Journal. His theoretical standpoints are divided into five sections outlined below.  ====What Education Is==== Education according to Dewey is the “participation of the individual in the social consciousness of the race” (Dewey, 1897, para. 1).  As such, education should take into account that the student is a social being. The process begins at birth with the child unconsciously gaining knowledge and gradually developing their knowledge to share and partake in society.  The educational process has two sides, the psychological and the sociological, with the psychological forming the basis. (Dewey, 1897). A child’s own instincts will help develop the material that is presented to them. These instincts also form the basis of their knowledge with everything building upon it. This forms the basis of Dewey’s assumption that one cannot learn without motivation.  Knowledge is a social condition and it is important to help students construct their own learning, as stated: “Hence it is impossible to prepare the child for any precise set of conditions. To prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities; that his eye and ear and hand may be tools ready to command, that his judgment may be capable of grasping the conditions under which it has to work, and the executive forces be trained to act economically and efficiently” (Dewey, 1897, Para. 7)  Instruction must focus on the child as a whole for you can never be sure as to where society may end or where that student will be needed or will take themselves.  ====What the school is==== “Education fails because it neglects this fundamental principle of the school as a form of community life. It conceives the school as a place where certain information is to be given, where certain lessons are to be learned, or where certain habits are to be formed” (Dewey, 1897, para. 17) Dewey felt that as education is a social construct, it is therefore a part of society and should reflect the community.  \"Education is the process of living and is not meant to be the preparation of future living,\" (Dewey, 1897), so school must represent the present life. As such, parts of the student’s home life (such as moral and ethical education) should take part in the schooling process. The teacher is a part of this, not as an authoritative figure, but as a member of the community who is there to assist the student.  ====The subject matter of education==== According to Dewey, the curriculum in the schools should reflect that of society. The center of the school curriculum should reflect the development of humans in society. The study of the core subjects (language, science, history) should be coupled with the study of cooking, sewing and manual training. Furthermore, he feels that “progress is not in the succession of studies but in the development of new attitudes towards, and new interests in, experience” (Dewey, 1897, para. 38)  ====The nature of method==== Method is focused on the child’s powers and interests. If the child is thrown into a passive role as a student, absorbing information, the result is a waste of the child’s education. (Dewey, 1897). Information presented to the student will be transformed into new forms, images and symbols by the student so that they fit with their development and interests. The development of this is natural. To repress this process and attempt to “substitute the adult for the child” (Dewey, 1897, para. 52) would weaken the intellectual curiosity of the child.  ====The school and social progress==== Education is the most fundamental method of social reconstruction for progress and reform. Dewey believes that “education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction” (Dewey, 1897, para. 60). As such, Dewey gives way to Social Reconstruction and schools as means to reconstruct society (See Social Reconstruction in Education).  Finally, as schools become a means for social reconstruction, our educations must be given the proper equipment to help perform this task and guide their students.<ref>Dewey, John. (1897).

The Laborschule explicitly uses democratic concepts as suggested by Dewey. Studies in the last years have proven the successful implementation of these concepts into a living community.  ===Rudolf Steiner=== [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1869-1925) first described the principles of what was to become [[Waldorf education]] in 1907. He established a series of schools based on these principles beginning in 1919. The focus of the education is on creating a developmentally-appropriate curriculum that holistically integrates practical, artistic, social, and academic experiences.<ref>* [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/steinere.pdf Heiner Ullrich, \"Rudolf Steiner\"], ''Prospects: the quarterly review of comparative education'' (Paris, UNESCO: International Bureau of Education), vol.XXIV, no. 3/4, 1994, p.&nbsp;555–572</ref><ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-big-question-who-was-rudolf-steiner-and-what-were-his-revolutionary-teaching-ideas-433407.html “Who was Rudolf Steiner and what were his revolutionary teaching ideas?” [[Richard Garner]], Education Editor, ''The Independent'']</ref> There are more than a thousand schools and many more [[early childhood]] centers worldwide; it has also become a popular form of [[homeschooling]].<ref name=schulliste>[http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Waldorf_World_List/Waldorf_World_List.pdf Statistics for Waldorf schools worldwide]</ref><ref>M.

She based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as \"scientific pedagogy\". Although Montessori education spread to the United States in 1911 there were conflicts with the American educational establishment and was opposed by William Heard Kilpatrick. However Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there.  ===Robert Baden-Powell=== In July 1906, [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] sent [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] a copy of his book ''The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians''. Seton was a British-born Canadian-American living in the United States. They shared ideas about youth training programs.<ref name=\"SetonInfed\">{{cite web |year=2002 |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/seton.htm |title=Ernest Thompson Seton and Woodcraft |publisher=InFed |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name=\"BPInfed\">{{cite web |year=2002 |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-bp.htm |title=Robert Baden-Powell as an Educational Innovator |publisher=InFed |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref> In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called ''Boy Patrols''. In the same year, to test his ideas, he gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds and held a week-long camp in August on [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|Brownsea Island]] in England.<ref>{{cite book|author=Woolgar, Brian|author2=La Riviere, Sheila|year=2002|title=Why Brownsea?

The Brownsea camp and the publication of  ''Scouting for Boys'' are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement which spread throughout the world. Baden-Powell and his sister [[Agnes Baden-Powell]] introduced the [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides]] in 1910.  ===Comparison with traditional education=== {{Main|Traditional education}}  Traditional education uses extrinsic motivation, such as grades and prizes. Progressive education is more likely to use intrinsic motivation, basing activities on the interests of the child.

[[Sebastien Faure]] in 1904 created a libertarian school 'La Ruche' (the Hive).  ===Germany=== Hermann Lietz founded three Landerziehungsheime (country boarding schools) in 1904 based on Reddie’s model for boys of different ages.

He had been influenced by Cecil Reddie. The [[Modern Schools]], also called 'Ferrer Schools', that were founded in the United States, were based on Escuela Moderna. As in Spain the schools were intended to educate the working-classes from a [[secular]], [[class-conscious]] perspective. The Modern Schools imparted day-time academic classes for children, and night-time continuing-education lectures for adults.  ===United Kingdom=== The ideas from Reddie's Abbotsholme spread to schools such as [[Bedales School]] (1893), [[King Alfred School, London]] (1898) and [[St Christopher School, Letchworth]] (1915), as well as all the [[Quakers|Friends’]] schools, [[Waldorf education|Steiner Waldorf]] schools and those belonging to the [[Round Square|Round Square Conference]]. The King Alfred School was radical for its time in that it provided a secular education and that boys and girls were educated together.<ref name=\"proged\">[http://www.kingalfred.org.uk/king-alfred-school/about-king-alfred-school/progressive-education.html A Progressive Education]</ref> [[Alexander Sutherland Neill]] believed children should achieve self-determination and should be encouraged to think critically rather than blindly obeying. He implemented his ideas with the founding of [[Summerhill School]] in 1921. Neill believed that children learn better when they are not compelled to attend lessons. The school was also managed democratically, with regular meetings to determine school rules. Pupils had equal voting rights with school staff.  ===United States===  ====Early practitioners==== Fröbel’s student [[Margarethe Schurz]] founded the first kindergarten in the [[United States]] at [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1856, and she also inspired [[Elizabeth Peabody]], who went on to found the first English-speaking kindergarten in the United States – the language at Schurz’s kindergarten had been German, to serve an immigrant community – in [[Boston]] in 1860. This paved the way for the concept’s spread in the USA. The German émigré Adolph Douai had also founded a kindergarten in Boston in 1859, but was obliged to close it after only a year. By 1866, however, he was founding others in [[New York City]].  [[William Heard Kilpatrick]] (1871–1965) was a pupil of Dewey and one of the most effective practitioners of the concept as well as the more adept at proliferating the progressive education movement and spreading word of the works of Dewey. He is especially well known for his “project method of teaching”.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/> This developed the progressive education notion that students were to be engaged and taught so that their knowledge may be directed to society for a socially useful need. Like Dewey he also felt that students should be actively engaged in their learning rather than actively disengaged with the simple reading and regurgitation of material.<ref name=\"Hayes\"/>  The most famous early practitioner of progressive education was [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; its best-known spokesperson was the philosopher [[John Dewey]].  In 1875 Francis Parker became superintendent of schools in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] after spending two years in [[Germany]] studying emerging educational trends on the continent. Parker was opposed to rote learning, believing that there was no value in knowledge without understanding. He argued instead schools should encourage and respect the child’s creativity. Parker’s [[Quincy Method|Quincy System]] called for child-centered and experience-based learning.   He replaced the traditional curriculum with integrated learning units based on core themes related to the knowledge of different disciplines. He replaced traditional readers, spellers and [[grammar]] books with children’s own writing, [[literature]], and teacher prepared materials. In 1883 Parker left Massachusetts to become Principal of the Cook County Normal School in [[Chicago]], a school that also served to train teachers in Parker’s methods. In 1894 Parker’s Talks on Pedagogics, which drew heavily on the thinking of [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]], became one of the first American writings on education to gain international fame.  That same year, philosopher John Dewey moved from the [[University of Michigan]] to the newly established [[University of Chicago]] where he became chair of the department of [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and education. He and his wife enrolled their children in Parker’s school before founding their own school two years later.  Whereas Parker started with practice and then moved to theory, Dewey began with hypotheses and then devised methods and curricula to test them. By the time Dewey moved to Chicago at the age of thirty-five, he had already published two books on psychology and applied psychology. He had become dissatisfied with philosophy as pure speculation and was seeking ways to make philosophy directly relevant to practical issues. Moving away from an early interest in [[Hegel]], Dewey proceeded to reject all forms of [[dualism]] and dichotomy in favor of a philosophy of experience as a series of unified wholes in which everything can be ultimately related.  In 1896, John Dewey opened what he called the laboratory school to test his theories and their sociological implications. With Dewey as the director and his wife as principal, the University of Chicago Laboratory school, was dedicated “to discover in administration, selection of subject-matter, methods of learning, teaching, and [[discipline]], how a school could become a cooperative community while developing in individuals their own capacities and satisfy their own needs.” (Cremin, 136) For Dewey the two key goals of developing a cooperative [[community]] and developing [[individual]]s’ own capacities were not at odds; they were necessary to each other. This unity of purpose lies at the heart of the progressive education philosophy. In 1912, Dewey sent out students of his philosophy to found [[The Park School of Buffalo]] and [[The Park School of Baltimore]] to put it into practice. These schools operate to this day within a similar progressive approach.  At Columbia, Dewey worked with other educators such as Charles Eliot and Abraham Flexner to help bring progressivism into the mainstream of American education. In 1917 Columbia established the Lincoln School of Teachers College “as a laboratory for the working out of an elementary and secondary curriculum which shall eliminate obsolete material and endeavor to work up in usable form material adapted to the needs of modern living.” (Cremin, 282)  Based on Flexner’s demand that the modern curriculum “include nothing for which an affirmative case can not be made out” (Cremin, 281) the new school organized its activities around four fundamental fields: [[science]], [[industry]], [[aesthetics]] and [[civics]]. The Lincoln School built its curriculum around “units of work” that reorganized traditional subject matter into forms embracing the development of [[child]]ren and the changing needs of adult life. The first and second grades carried on a study of community life in which they actually built a city. A third grade project growing out of the day-to-day life of the nearby [[Hudson River]] became one of the most celebrated units of the school, a unit on boats, which under the guidance of its legendary teacher Miss Curtis, became an entrée into [[history]], [[geography]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[arithmetic]], science, [[art]] and literature. Each of the units was broadly enough conceived so that different children could concentrate on different aspects depending on their own interests and needs. Each of the units called for widely diverse student activities, and each sought to deal in depth with some critical aspect of contemporary civilization. Finally each unit engaged children working together cooperatively and also provided opportunities for individual research and exploration.  In 1924, [[Agnes de Lima]], the lead writer on education for [[The New Republic]] and [[The Nation|Nation]], published a collection of her articles on progressive education as a book, titled ''Our Enemy the Child''.<ref>Agnes de Lima.  In James Guthrie, Editor in Chief, ''Encyclopedia of Education'' (pp.&nbsp;553–554).  New York: Thomson Gale (2003).</ref>   In 1918 The [[National Education Association]], representing superintendents and administrators in smaller districts across the country, issued its report \"Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education.\"  It emphasized the education of students in terms of health, a command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. They Emphasized life adjustment and reflected the social efficiency model of progressive education.<ref>Karen Graves, \"The Cardinal Principles,,\" ''American Educational History Journal'' (2010) 37#1-2, pp 95-107</ref>   From 1919 to 1955 the Progressive Education Association founded by [[Stanwood Cobb#Career as educator|Stanwood Cobb]] and others worked to promote a more student-centered approach to education. During the [[Great Depression]] the organization conducted an Eight Year study evaluating the effects of progressive programs. More than 1500 students over four years were compared to an equal number of carefully matched students at conventional schools. When they reached college, the experimental students were found to equal or surpass traditionally educated students on all outcomes: grades, extracurricular participation, dropout rates, intellectual curiosity, and resourcefulness. Moreover, the study found that the more the school departed from the traditional college preparatory program, the better was the record of the graduates. (Kohn, Schools, 232)  By mid-century many public school programs had also adopted elements of progressive curriculum. At mid-century Dewey believed that progressive education had “not really penetrated and permeated the foundations of the educational institution.”(Kohn, Schools, 6,7)  As the influence of progressive pedagogy grew broader and more diffuse, practitioners began to vary their application of progressive principles.   As varying interpretations and practices made evaluation of progressive reforms more difficult to assess, critics began to propose alternative approaches.  The seeds of the debate over progressive education can be seen in the differences of Parker and Dewey. These have to do with how much and by whom curriculum should be worked out from grade to grade, how much the child’s emerging interests should determine classroom activities, the importance of child-centered vs. societal–centered learning, the relationship of community building to individual growth, and especially the relationship between emotion, thought and experience.  In 1955 the publication of Rudolf Flesch's ''[[Rudolf Flesch#Professional Information|Why Johnny Can’t Read]]'' leveled criticism of reading programs at the progressive emphasis on reading in context. The conservative [[McCarthy era]] raised questions about the liberal ideas at the roots of the progressive reforms. The launching of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 at the height of the [[cold war]] gave rise to a number of intellectually competitive approaches to disciplinary knowledge, such as [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study|BSCS]] biology [[Physical Science Study Committee|PSSC]] physics, led by university professors such as [[Jerome Bruner]] and [[Jerrold Zacharias]].  Interestingly, some of the cold war reforms incorporated elements of progressivism. For example, the work of Zacharias and Bruner was based in the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] and incorporated many of Dewey’s ideas of experiential education. Bruner’s analysis of developmental psychology became the core of a pedagogical movement known as [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], which argues that the child is an active participant in making meaning and must be engaged in the progress of education for learning to be effective. This psychological approach has deep connections to the work of both Parker and Dewey and led to a resurgence of their ideas in second half of the century.  In 1965, President Johnson inaugurated the [[Great Society]] and the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] suffused public school programs with funds for sweeping education reforms. At the same time the influx of federal funding also gave rise to demands for accountability and the behavioral objectives approach of Robert F. Mager and others foreshadowed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] passed in 2002. Against these critics eloquent spokespersons stepped forward in defense of the progressive tradition. The [[Open classroom|Open Classroom]] movement, led by [[Herbert Kohl (education)|Herb Kohl]] and George Dennison, recalled many of Parker's child centered reforms.<ref>Barrow Street Nursery School--A private progressive nursery school in the West Village of Manhattan.

Taxpayer revolts, leading to cuts in funding for public education in many states, have led to the founding of an unprecedented number of independent schools, many of which have progressive philosophies. The charter school movement has also spawned an increase in progressive programs. Most recently, public outcry against No Child Left Behind testing and [[teaching to the test]] has brought progressive education again into the limelight. Despite the variations that still exist among the progressive programs throughout the country, most progressive schools today are vitalized by these common practices:  * The curriculum is more flexible and is influenced by student interest * Teachers are facilitators of learning who encourage students to use a wide variety of activities to learn * Progressive teachers use a wider variety of materials allowing for individual and group research. * Progressive teachers encourage students to learn by discovery * Progressive education programs often include the use of community resources and encourage service-learning projects.  ====Education outside of schools==== Organizations like the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and [[Camp Fire]] arose, even amidst concerns by opponents of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]], because some people felt that [[social welfare]] of young men should be maintained through education alone.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} After decades of growing interest in and development of [[experiential education]] and [[scouting in the United States|scouting (not Scouting) in the United States]], and the emergence of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]] in 1907, in 1910 Boy Scouts of America was founded in the merger of three older [[Scouting]] organizations: Boy Scouts of the United States, the National Scouts of America and the Peace Scouts of California.<ref name=\"americanadv\">{{cite book |author=Peterson, Robert W. |title=The Boy Scouts: An American Adventure |publisher=American Heritage |year=1984 |isbn=0-8281-1173-1}}</ref> Its founder, Chicago publisher [[William D.

Each electrode may become either the anode or the cathode depending on the direction of current through the cell. A bipolar electrode is an electrode that functions as the anode of one cell and the cathode of another cell.  === Primary cell === A [[primary cell]] is a special type of electrochemical cell in which the reaction cannot be reversed, and the identities of the anode and cathode are therefore fixed. The anode is always the negative electrode. The cell can be discharged but not recharged.  === Secondary cell === A [[secondary cell]], for example a [[rechargeable battery]], is a cell in which the chemical reactions are reversible. When the cell is being charged, the anode becomes the positive (+) and the cathode the negative (−) electrode. This is also the case in an [[electrolytic cell]]. When the cell is being discharged, it behaves like a primary cell, with the anode as the negative and the cathode as the positive electrode.  ==Other anodes and cathodes == In a [[vacuum tube]] or a [[semiconductor]] having polarity ([[diode]]s, [[electrolytic|electrolytic capacitor]]s) the anode is the positive (+) electrode and the cathode the negative (−). The electrons enter the device through the cathode and exit the device through the anode. Many devices have other electrodes to control operation, e.g., base, gate, control grid.  In a three-electrode cell, a counter electrode, also called an [[auxiliary electrode]], is used only to make a connection to the electrolyte so that a current can be applied to the working electrode. The counter electrode is usually made of an inert material, such as a [[noble metal]] or [[graphite]], to keep it from dissolving.  == Welding electrodes == In [[arc welding]] an electrode is used to conduct current through a workpiece to fuse two pieces together. Depending upon the process, the electrode is either consumable, in the case of [[gas metal arc welding]] or [[shielded metal arc welding]], or non-consumable, such as in [[gas tungsten arc welding]]. For a direct current system the weld rod or stick may be a cathode for a filling type weld or an anode for other welding processes. For an alternating current arc welder the welding electrode would not be considered an anode or cathode.  == Alternating current electrodes == For electrical systems which use [[alternating current]] the electrodes are the connections from the circuitry to the object to be acted upon by the electric current but are not designated anode or cathode because the direction of flow of the electrons changes [[alternating current|periodically]], usually many [[hertz|times per second]].  == Uses == Electrodes are used to provide current through nonmetal objects to alter them in numerous ways and to measure conductivity for numerous purposes. Examples include: *Electrodes for [[fuel cell]]s *Electrodes for medical purposes, such as [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] (for recording brain activity), [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] (recording [[Cardiac cycle|heart beats]]), [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] (electrical brain stimulation), [[defibrillator]] (recording and delivering cardiac stimulation) *Electrodes for [[electrophysiology]] techniques in biomedical research *Electrodes for execution by the [[electric chair]] *Electrodes for [[electroplating]] *Electrodes for [[arc welding]] *Electrodes for [[cathodic protection]] *Electrodes for [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] *Electrodes for [[chemical analysis]] using [[electrochemical]] methods *Inert electrodes for [[electrolysis]] (made of [[platinum]]) *[[Membrane electrode assembly]]  ==Chemically modified electrodes== [[Chemically modified electrode]]s are electrodes that have their surfaces chemically modified to change the electrode's [[Physical property|physical]], [[chemical]], [[electrochemical]], [[optical]], [[electrical]], and [[transport]] properties.

         "'''Evidence-based medicine''' ('''EBM''') is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize [[decision-making]] by emphasizing the use of [[evidence]] from well designed and conducted [[research]]. Although all medicine based on [[science]] has some degree of [[empirical evidence|empirical]] support, EBM goes further, classifying evidence by its [[epistemology|epistemologic]] strength and requiring that only the strongest types (coming from [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], [[systematic review]]s, and [[randomized controlled trial]]s) can yield strong recommendations; weaker types (such as from [[case-control study|case-control studies]]) can yield only weak recommendations. The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients.<ref name=\"Guyatt\">{{cite journal |title=Evidence-based medicine.

Whether applied to medical education, decisions about individuals, guidelines and policies applied to populations, or administration of health services in general, evidence-based medicine advocates that to the greatest extent possible, decisions and policies should be based on evidence, not just the beliefs of practitioners, experts, or administrators. It thus tries to assure that a [[clinician]]'s opinion, which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases, is supplemented with all available knowledge from the [[scientific literature]] so that [[best practice]] can be determined and applied. It promotes the use of formal, explicit methods to analyze evidence and make it available to decision makers. It promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students, practitioners, and policy makers.  ==Background, history and definition== In its broadest form, evidence-based medicine is the application of the scientific method into healthcare decision-making. Medicine has a long tradition of both basic and clinical research that dates back at least to [[Avicenna]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brater DC, Daly WJ |title=Clinical pharmacology in the Middle Ages: principles that presage the 21st century |journal=Clin.

Called \"clinical judgment\" and \"the art of medicine\", the traditional approach to making decisions about individual patients depended on having each individual physician determine what research evidence, if any, to consider, and how to merge that evidence with personal beliefs and other factors. In the case of decisions that applied to groups of patients or populations, the guidelines and policies would usually be developed by committees of experts, but there was no formal process for determining the extent to which research evidence should be considered or how it should be merged with the beliefs of the committee members. There was an implicit assumption that decision makers and policy makers would incorporate evidence in their thinking appropriately, based on their education, experience, and ongoing study of the applicable literature.   ===Clinical decision making=== Beginning in the late 1960s, several flaws became apparent in the traditional approach to medical decision-making. [[Alvan Feinstein]]'s publication of ''Clinical Judgment'' in 1967 focused attention on the role of clinical reasoning and identified biases that can affect it.<ref name=\"feinstein\">{{cite book|author=Alvan R.

Chronologically, the first is the insistence on explicit evaluation of evidence of effectiveness when issuing clinical practice guidelines and other population-level policies. The second is the introduction of epidemiological methods into medical education and individual patient-level decision-making.  ===Evidence-based guidelines and policies=== The term \"evidence-based\" was first used by David M. Eddy in the course of his work on population-level policies such as clinical practice guidelines and insurance coverage of new technologies. He first began to use the term \"evidence-based\" in 1987 in workshops and a manual commissioned by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to teach formal methods for designing clinical practice guidelines. The manual was widely available in unpublished form in the late 1980s and eventually published by the American College of Medicine.<ref name=\"eddy4\">{{Cite book|author=Eddy DM|title=A Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Policies |publisher=American College of Physicians|date=1992 |isbn=0943126185}}</ref><ref name=\"field\">{{cite book |author=Committee to Advise the Public Health Service on Clinical Practice Guidelines, Institute of Medicine |editor-last=Field |editor-first=M.J. |editor2-last=Lohr |editor2-first=K.N.  |title=Clinical Practice Guidelines: Directions for a New Program |publisher=National Academy of Sciences Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-309-07666-1 |page=32 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1626&page=32}}</ref> Eddy first published the term \"evidence-based\" in March, 1990 in an article in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' that laid out the principles of evidence-based guidelines and population-level policies, which Eddy described as \"explicitly describing the available evidence that pertains to a policy and tying the policy to evidence. Consciously anchoring a policy, not to current practices or the beliefs of experts, but to experimental evidence. The policy must be consistent with and supported by evidence. The pertinent evidence must be identified, described, and analyzed. The policymakers must determine whether the policy is justified by the evidence.

The methods were published to a broad physician audience in a series of 25 \"Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature\" published in ''JAMA'' between 1993 and 2000 by the Evidence based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University. Other definitions for individual level evidence-based medicine have been put forth. For example, in 1995 Rosenberg and Donald defined it as \"the process of finding, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for medical decisions.\"<ref name=\"rosenberg2\">{{cite journal|author=Rosenberg W, Donald A|title=Evidence-based Medicine: An approach to Clinical Problem Solving|journal=BMJ|volume=310|pages=1122–6|doi=10.1136/bmj.310.6987.1122 |year=1995 |pmid=7742682 |pmc=2549505 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7742682}}</ref> In 2010, Greenhalgh used a definition that emphasized quantitative methods: \"the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in the diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients.\"<ref name=\"greenhalgh1\">{{cite book|last=Greenhalgh |first=Trisha |authorlink=Trisha Greenhalgh|date=2010|title=How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence-Based Medicine (4th ed.)|publisher= John Wiley & Sons|page= 1|isbn=978-1-4443-9036-0}}</ref> Many other definitions have been offered for individual level evidence-based medicine, but the one by Sackett and colleagues is the most commonly cited.<ref name=sackett2 />  The two original definitions highlight important differences in how evidence-based medicine is applied to populations versus individuals.

On the medical education side, programs to teach evidence-based medicine have been created in medical schools in Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, and other countries. A 2009 study of UK programs found the more than half of UK medical schools offered some training in evidence-based medicine, although there was considerable variation in the methods and content, and EBM teaching was restricted by lack of curriculum time, trained tutors and teaching materials.<ref name=\"medteach\">{{cite journal|author=Meats E1, Heneghan C, Crilly M, Glasziou P|title=Evidence-based medicine teaching in UK medical schools|journal=Med Teach|date=April 2009|volume=31|issue=4|pages=332–7|doi=10.1080/01421590802572791 |pmid=19404893 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01421590802572791}}</ref> Many programs have been developed to help individual physicians gain better access to evidence.

By 2000, \"evidence-based medicine\" had become an umbrella term for the emphasis on evidence in both population-level and individual-level decisions. In subsequent years, use of the term \"evidence-based\" had extended to other levels of the health care system. An example is \"evidence-based health services\", which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level.<ref name=\"gray\">{{cite book|author=Gray, J. A. Muir|date=2009|title=Evidence-based Health Care & Public Health|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=9780443101236}}</ref> The concept has also spread outside of healthcare; for example, in his 1996 inaugural speech as President of the Royal Statistical Society, Adrian Smith proposed that \"[[evidence-based policy]]\" should be established for education, prisons and policing policy and all areas of government work.  The multiple tributaries of evidence based medicine share an emphasis on the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions. However they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promulgating a guideline or payment policy, and they differ on the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual-level information in decisions. Thus, evidence-based guidelines and policies may not readily 'hybridise' with experience-based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement, and can lead to contradictions, contest, and unintended crises.<ref name=eddy5 /> The most effective 'knowledge leaders' (managers and clinical leaders) use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making, rather than just formal evidence.<ref name=feinstein2 /> Evidence-based guidelines may provide the basis for [[governmentality]] in health care and consequently play a central role in the distant governance of contemporary health care systems.<ref name=sackett />  ==Methods==  ===Steps=== The steps for designing explicit, evidence based guidelines were described in the late 1980s: Formulate the question (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcomes, time horizon, setting); search the literature to identify studies that inform the question; interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question; if several studies address the question, synthesize their results (meta-analysis); summarize the evidence in \"evidence tables\"; compare the benefits, harms and costs in a \"balance sheet\"; draw a conclusion about the preferred practice; write the guideline; write the rationale for the guideline; have others review each of the previous steps; implement the guideline.<ref name=eddy4/>  For the purposes of medical education and individual-level decision making, five steps of EBM in practice were described in 1992<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cook DJ, Jaeschke R, Guyatt GH |title=Critical appraisal of therapeutic interventions in the intensive care unit: human monoclonal antibody treatment in sepsis.

Evidence-based medicine categorizes different types of clinical evidence and rates or grades them<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/product/ebm_loe.cfm?show=grade |title=EBM: Levels of Evidence |publisher=Essential Evidence Plus |accessdate=2012-02-23}}</ref> according to the strength of their freedom from the various biases that beset medical research. For example, the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of [[randomized]], triple-blind, [[placebo-controlled trials]] with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition. In contrast, patient testimonials, case reports, and even expert opinion (however some critics have argued that expert opinion \"does not belong in the rankings of the quality of [[empirical evidence]] because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence\" and continue that \"expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone.\")<ref name=\"Tonelli99\">{{cite journal |author=Tonelli MR |title=In defense of expert opinion |journal=Acad Med |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1187–92 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10587679  |doi=10.1097/00001888-199911000-00010}}</ref> have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more.  Several organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence.

Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence. * Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.  Another example of a system for grading evidence is the Oxford (UK) CEBM Levels of Evidence, Most of the evidence ranking schemes grade evidence for therapy and prevention, but not for diagnostic tests, prognostic markers, or harm. The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence addresses this issue and provides 'Levels' of evidence for claims about prognosis, diagnosis, treatment benefits, treatment harms, and screening. The original CEBM Levels was first released in September 2000 for Evidence-Based On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit. In 2011, the Oxford CEBM Levels were redesigned by an international team to make it more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes. The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients, clinicians and also to develop clinical guidelines including recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in [[psoriasis]]<ref>{{cite web|last=OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group|title=The Oxford Levels of Evidence 2’|url=http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653}}</ref> and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=C.|author2=Gallini A|author3=Archier E|title=Evidence-Based Recommendations on Topical Treatment and Phototherapy of Psoriasis: Systematic Review and Expert Opinion of a Panel of Dermatologists|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology|year=2012|volume=26 |issue=Suppl 3|pages=1–10|pmid=22512675 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2012.04518.x|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  ===Categories of recommendations=== In guidelines and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit of the service and the level of evidence on which this information is based.

Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients. * Level B: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients. * Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that there are benefits provided by the clinical service, but the balance between benefits and risks are too close for making general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless there are individual considerations. * Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients. * Level I: Scientific evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed. Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service.  A system was developed by the GRADE working group and takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research.<ref name=\"GRADE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ |title=GRADE working group |accessdate=2007-09-24 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5EyFmnBjw | archivedate = 2006-04-07| deadurl=no}}</ref> It requires users of GRADE (short for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a systematic review, to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results. Authors of GRADE tables, grade the quality of evidence into four levels, on the basis of their confidence in the observed effect (a numerical value) being close to what the true effect is. The confidence value is based on judgements assigned in five different domains in a structured manner.<ref name=\"balshem2011\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Balshem H, Helfand M, Schünemann HJ, etal |title=GRADE guidelines: 3.

In the case of observational studies, the quality of evidence starts of lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading.<ref name=\"GRADE Handbook\">{{cite book|title=GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendation|year=2009|url=Available from http://www.cc-ims.net/gradepro|edition=Version 3.2|editor=Schünemann H, Brożek J, Oxman A,}} {{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>  * Large effect: This is when methodologically strong studies show that the observed effect is so large that the probability of it changing completely is less likely. * Plausible confounding would change the effect: This is when despite the presence of a possible confounding factor which is expected to reduce the observed effect, the effect estimate still shows significant effect. * Dose response gradient: This is when the intervention used becomes more effective with increasing dose. This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.  Meaning of the levels of Quality of evidence as per GRADE<ref name=\"balshem2011\"/> * High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the estimate that is presented lies very close to the true value. One could interpret it as: there is very low probability of further research completely changing the presented conclusions. * Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. One could also interpret it as: further research may completely change the conclusions. * Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate and the true value may be substantially different. One could interpret it as: further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely. * Very low quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. One could interpret it as: New research will most probably change the presented conclusions completely.  Guideline panelists may make '''Strong''' or '''Weak recommendations''' on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are:<ref name=\"GRADE Handbook\"/> * Balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost) * Quality of the evidence * Values and preferences * Costs (resource utilization)  Despite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.  ===Statistical measures=== Evidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:  *Likelihood ratio {{main|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}} The [[pre-test odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[pre- and post-test probability|post-test odds]]. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects [[Bayes' theorem]]. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation. *AUC-ROC The area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between [[sensitivity and specificity]] for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC. *Number needed to treat / harm. Number needed to treat or Number needed to harm are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful. NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome (e.g. survival from cancer) in one patient. For example if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5%, then 20 people need to be treated in order to have 1 additional patient survive due to the treatment. The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests. For example if 1339 women age 50 -59 have to be invited for breast cancer screening over a ten year period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer,<ref name=\"BandolierStatins2004\">\"Patient Compliance with statins\" ''[[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] [http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html Review] 2004</ref> then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339.  ===Quality of clinical trials=== Evidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.  *Trial design considerations. High-quality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data.  *Generalizability considerations. Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts.  *Follow-up. Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the prospective study outcomes and the [[statistical power]] of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm.  *Power. A mathematical calculation can determine if the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms. A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit, or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference.  ==Limitations and criticism== Although evidence-based medicine is regarded as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of [[conventional medicine|clinical practice]], there are a number of limitations and criticisms of its use<ref name=\"Timmermans2005\">{{cite journal |author=Timmermans S, Mauck A |title=The promises and pitfalls of evidence-based medicine |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18–28 |year=2005 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/1/18.long |pmid=15647212 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.18 }}</ref> many of which remain unresolved despite nearly two centuries of debate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poisson, Dulong, Larrey, Double |title=Statistical research on conditions caused by calculi by Doctor Civiale. |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=1246–9 |year=2001 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.6.1246 |url=http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1246 |origyear=1835 |pmid=11821317}}</ref>  * EBM produces quantitative research, especially from [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs).

He had hoped to represent the Netherlands in the United Nations. He graduated in 1948 with the highest possible marks in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. So his teachers and parents counseled him to seek a career in the sciences. He decided to join the [[University of Leiden]], to study mathematics and physics during the first years, and [[theoretical physics]] later on.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  In the early 1950s, [[electronic computers]] were a novelty. Dijkstra stumbled on his career quite by accident. His father had seen an advertisement for a three-week course in programming for the electronic computer [[EDSAC]], to be given at [[Cambridge University]], and he advised his son to attend the course. Dijkstra felt that computers might become an important tool for theoretical physicists, and he decided to attend this course in September 1951. When he asked his supervisor, Professor dr. A. Haantjes, for a letter of recommendation, it turned out that Professor Haantjes knew [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], the director of the Computation Department at the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]], and he knew that van Wijngaarden had taken the same course in 1950. Professor Haantjes phoned van Wijngaarden who invited Dijkstra to visit the Mathematical Center and wrote the letter of recommendation. Van Wijngaarden also offered Dijkstra a job, which he accepted, becoming officially the Netherlands’ first “programmer” in March 1952.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  In 1956 he graduated from the [[Leiden University]] in mathematics and theoretical physics. In 1959 he received his PhD from the [[University of Amsterdam]] for his thesis entitled ‘Communication with an Automatic Computer’, devoted to a description of the assembly language designed for the first commercial computer developed in the Netherlands, the X1. It also dealt with the concept of an interrupt, a novelty at that time. His PhD thesis supervisor was van Wijngaarden.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>  For some time Dijkstra remained committed to physics, working on it in [[Leiden]] three days out of each week. With increasing exposure to computing, however, his focus began to shift. As he recalled:<ref name=\"ewd340\">[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html E. W. Dijkstra Archive]</ref> {{quote |After having programmed for some three years, I had a discussion with [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden|A. van Wijngaarden]], who was then my boss at the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]], a discussion for which I shall remain grateful to him as long as I live. The point was that I was supposed to study [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of Leiden]] simultaneously, and as I found the two activities harder and harder to combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become a real, respectable [[theoretical physicist]], or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to become....., yes what? A [[programmer]]? But was that a respectable profession? For after all, what was [[Computer programming|programming]]? Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline? I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues, who, when asked about their professional competence, could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest, whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand empty-handed. Full of misgivings I knocked on van Wijngaarden’s office door, asking him whether I could “speak to him for a moment”; when I left his office a number of hours later, I was another person. For after having listened to my problems patiently, he agreed that up till that moment there was not much of a programming discipline, but then he went on to explain quietly that automatic computers were here to stay, that we were just at the beginning and could not I be one of the persons called to make programming a respectable discipline in the years to come? This was a turning point in my life and I completed my study of physics formally as quickly as I could.|Edsger Dijkstra|The Humble Programmer (EWD340)|[[Communications of the ACM]]}}  When Dijkstra married Maria (Ria) C. Debets in 1957, he was required as a part of the marriage rites to state his profession. He stated that he was a programmer, which was unacceptable to the authorities, there being no such profession at that time in The Netherlands.<ref>[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html E. W. Dijkstra Archive]. “Another two years later, in 1957, I married and Dutch marriage rites require you to state your profession and I stated that I was a programmer. But the municipal authorities of the town of Amsterdam did not accept it on the grounds that there was no such profession. And, believe it or not, but under the heading “profession” my marriage act shows the ridiculous entry “theoretical physicist”!”</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/people/144-dijkstra.html |author=James, Mike |title=''Edsger Dijkstra - The Poetry of Programming'' |publisher=i-programmer.info |date=1 May 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref>  ===Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam=== From 1952 until 1962 Dijkstra worked at the [[Mathematisch Centrum]] in Amsterdam.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/> The early computers were built out of vacuum tubes. They occupied large amounts of space, consumed power voraciously, and failed regularly. As Dijkstra recalls, “In retrospect one can only wonder that those first machines worked at all, at least sometimes. The overwhelming problem was to get and keep the machine in working order.”<ref>[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html Edsger W. Dijkstra Archive]</ref>  He worked closely with [[Bram Jan Loopstra]] and [[Carel S. Scholten]], who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of interaction remains a model of disciplined engineering: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers would have to be faithful to their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned from this experience were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/> Dijkstra formulated and solved the [[shortest path problem]] for a demonstration at the official inauguration of the ARMAC computer in 1956, but —because of the absence of journals dedicated to automatic computing— did not publish the result until 1959.  At the Mathematical Center, Dijkstra and his colleague [[J. A. Zonneveld]] developed a [[compiler]] for the programming language [[ALGOL 60]]; it had a profound influence on his later thinking on programming as a scientific activity. He and Zonneveld had completed the implementation of the first [[ALGOL 60]] [[compiler]] by August 1960, more than a year before a compiler was produced by another group.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  ===Eindhoven University of Technology=== In 1962 Dijkstra moved to [[Eindhoven]], where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]. Then in 1964 they moved to a newly built house in [[Nuenen]], a small village on the outskirts of Eindhoven.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>  The university did not have a separate computer science department and the culture of the mathematics department did not particularly suit him. Dijkstra tried to build a group of computer scientists who could collaborate on solving problems. This was an unusual model of research for the Mathematics Department.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  In the late 1960s he built the [[THE multiprogramming system|THE operating system]] (named for the university, then known as [[Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven]]), which has influenced the designs of subsequent [[operating systems]].  ===Burroughs Corporation=== Dijkstra joined [[Burroughs Corporation]] as its Research Fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the company’s research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen. He was already very famous by that time, and he received a large number of invitations to lecture throughout the world. He used these visits to interact with other computer scientists, mentor younger scientists, and sharpen his skills as an English speaker. He also established the Eindhoven Tuesday Afternoon Club (ETAC), a group of researchers who met every Tuesday afternoon in the campus of the university to work on a scientific problem or discuss a recently published paper.<ref name=\"Apt, Krzysztof R. 2002\"/>  The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series (described below), most of them technical reports, for private circulation within a select group.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  ===The University of Texas at Austin=== Dijkstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the Computer Science Department at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1984. He had been visiting the Burroughs Research Center in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] since the late 1970s and had become quite familiar with the Department of Computer Science and its faculty. As he says in an autobiographical note, “...when The University of Texas at Austin offered me the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences, the offer was actually welcome. The offer was not so surprising, nor my acceptance, for I knew Austin, I knew UT and they knew me. All through my years at Burroughs I had made it a rule to visit, wherever I went, the local university and since the late 70s Burroughs had had an Austin Research Center, a visit to which was included in most of my trips to the USA.”<ref>[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD11xx/EWD1166.html Edsger W. Dijkstra Archive]</ref> Dijkstra remained prolific in research during his years at Austin. He had embarked on a long-term project on “Streamlining Mathematical Arguments”.  The years in Austin saw Dijkstra at his best as a teacher and mentor for a generation of students, both undergraduate and graduate. From his days in the Eindhoven University of Technology, he had thought deeply about how computer science should be taught. He had sharpened his thinking on education over a number of years, and Austin provided him the opportunity for trying out his ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://syedirfanhyder.blogspot.com/2013/03/beauty-is-our-business-mathematics-and.html |author=Irfan Hyder, Syed |title=''Learning and Life: Beauty is Our Business - Mathematics, Excellence and the Great Dijkstra'' |publisher=syedirfanhyder.blogspot.com |date=25 March 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://syedirfanhyder.blogspot.com/2013/12/fairness-in-grading-lesson-by-dijkstra.html |author=Irfan Hyder, Syed |title=''Learning and Life: Fairness in Grading: A Lesson by the Great Dijkstra'' |publisher=syedirfanhyder.blogspot.com |date=12 December 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref>  ===Last years=== Dijkstra worked in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] until his retirement  in November 1999.

He said that he wanted to retire in Austin, [[Texas]], but to die in the Netherlands.

Many of his papers are the source of new research areas. Many concepts that are now standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra and/or bear names coined by him. Several important problems were also first formulated and solved by him. A 1994 survey of over a thousand professors of computer science was conducted to obtain a list of 38 most influential scholarly papers in the field, and Dijkstra is the author of five papers.<ref>Laplante, Phillip A. (1996 & 2008)</ref>  During his forty-plus years as a computing scientist, which included positions in both academia and industry, Dijkstra made numerous seminal contributions to many areas of [[computing science]], including [[compiler construction]], [[operating systems]], [[concurrent programming]]/[[concurrent computing]], [[distributed computing]]/[[distributed programming]], [[programming paradigm]] and methodology, [[Programming language theory|programming language]] research, [[Software design|program design]], [[software development|program development]], [[program verification]], [[software engineering]] principles, [[algorithm design]], and philosophical foundations of [[computer science]] and [[computer programming]]. In addition, Dijkstra was intensely interested in [[On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science|teaching computer science]], and in the relationships between academic computing science and the [[software industry]].    ===Algorithmic work=== [[File:Dijkstra Animation.gif|Dijkstra's algorithm runtime|thumb |Dijkstra's algorithm. It picks the unvisited vertex with the lowest-distance, calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the neighbor's distance if smaller. Mark visited (set to red) when done with neighbors.]]  Dijkstra's algorithmic work (especially [[graph algorithms]], [[concurrent algorithm|concurrent algorithms]], and [[distributed algorithms]]) plays an important role in many areas of computing science. According to [[Leslie Lamport]] (2002), Dijkstra “started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]] with his 1965 CACM paper “Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control”, in which he first stated and solved the mutual exclusion problem.” As Lamport explains, “that paper is probably why [[PODC]] exists (...). It remains to this day the most influential paper in the field. That it did not win a [[PODC Influential-Paper Award|PODC Influential Paper Award]] reflects an artificial separation between concurrent and distributed algorithms–a separation that has never existed in Dijkstra’s work.”<ref>[http://www.podc.org/influential/2002-influential-paper/ 2002 PODC Influential Paper Award (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]. The following is a description of the winning paper’s contribution, written by [[Leslie Lamport]]: “Edsger W. Dijkstra started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]] with his 1965 CACM paper “Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control”, in which he first stated and solved the mutual exclusion problem. That paper is probably why PODC exists; it certainly inspired most of my work. It remains to this day the most influential paper in the field.”</ref>   In 1959 Dijkstra published in a 3-page article ‘A note on two problems in connexion with graphs’ the [[algorithm]] to find the shortest path in a graph, now called [[Dijkstra's algorithm]]. Its impact over the next 40 years is summarised from the article of [[Mikkel Thorup]], ‘Undirected Single Source Shortest Paths with Positive Integer Weights in Linear Time’ (1999): “Since 1959, all theoretical developments in SSSP [Single-Source Shortest Paths] for general directed and undirected graphs have been based on Dijkstra’s algorithm.” Dijkstra's algorithm is used in SPF, [[Shortest Path First]], which is used in the routing protocols [[Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] and [[IS-IS]]. Various modifications to Dijkstra’s algorithm have been proposed by many authors using [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] to reduce the run time of [[shortest path search]]. One of the most used heuristic algorithms is the [[A* search algorithm]], the main goal is to reduce the run time by reducing the search space. [[A* search algorithm]] (first described by [[Peter E. Hart|Peter Hart]], [[Nils John Nilsson|Nils Nilsson]] and [[Bertram Raphael]] of [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] in 1968)<ref name=\"nilsson\">{{cite journal  | first = P.

Dijkstra thought about the [[shortest path problem]] when working at the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|Mathematical Center in Amsterdam]] in 1956 as a [[computer programmer|programmer]] to demonstrate capabilities of a new [[computer]] called [[ARMAC]]. His objective was to choose both a problem as well as an answer (that would be produced by computer) that non-computing people could understand. He designed the [[Dijkstra's algorithm|shortest path algorithm]] in about 20 minutes without aid of paper and pen and later implemented it for ARMAC for a slightly simplified transportation map of 64 cities in Netherland (ARMAC was a 6-bit computer and hence could hold 64 cities comfortably).<ref>Frana, Philip L. (2001). \"An Interview with Edsger W. Dijkstra (OH 330)\". Communications of the ACM 53 (8): 41–47. doi:10.1145/1787234.1787249. “What is the shortest way to travel from Rotterdam to Groningen, in general: from given city to given city. It is the algorithm for the shortest path, which I designed in about twenty minutes. One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fiancée, and tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute invention. In fact, it was published in ’59, three years late. The publication is still readable, it is, in fact, quite nice. One of the reasons that it is so nice was that I designed it without pencil and paper. I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without pencil and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable complexities. Eventually that algorithm became, to my great amazement, one of the cornerstones of my fame.”</ref>  A year later, he came across another problem from hardware engineers working on the institute's next computer: minimize the amount of wire needed to connect the pins on the back panel of the machine. As a solution, he re-discovered the algorithm known as [[Prim's algorithm|Prim's]] [[Minimum spanning tree|minimal spanning tree algorithm]]. The [[Prim's algorithm]] was originally developed in 1930 by [[Czech people|Czech]] mathematician [[Vojtěch Jarník]]<ref>{{citation  | last = Jarník | first = V. | author-link = Vojtěch Jarník  | journal = Práce Moravské Přírodovědecké Společnosti  | language = Czech  | pages = 57–63  | title = O jistém problému minimálním  | trans_title = About a certain minimal problem  | url = http://dml.cz/dmlcz/500726  | volume = 6  | year = 1930}}.</ref> and later independently rediscovered and republished by [[Robert C.

The [[algorithm]] was named the \"shunting yard\" algorithm because its operation resembles that of a [[classification yard|railroad shunting yard]]. The shunting-yard algorithm is commonly used to implement [[operator-precedence parser]]s.  In mid-1960s Dijkstra proposed the [[mutual exclusion]] algorithm for n processes (a generalization of [[Dekker's algorithm]]), which was probably the first published [[concurrent algorithm]] and which introduced a new area of algorithmic research. He also identified the [[deadlock]] problem and proposed the [[banker's algorithm]] that [[Deadlock prevention algorithms|prevents deadlock]].  In 1974 Dijkstra presented three [[self-stabilization|self-stabilizing]] algorithms for [[mutual exclusion]] on a ring. Dijkstra's work is considered to be the first to introduce and demonstrate the [[self-stabilization]] concept.<ref>Dolev, Shlomi (2000). ''Self-stabilization''. (MIT Press), p. 16</ref>  In the mid-1970s Dijkstra (together with other authors) introduced two useful abstractions (mutator and collector) to the study of [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]. The mutator abstracts the process that performs the computation, including allocation of a new storage cell. The collector is the process that automatically reclaims garbage. Furthermore this paper gives a formalization of “[[Tracing garbage collection#Tri-color marking|tri-color marking]]” that is basic to incremental garbage collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=4&uid=15 |title=''People Behind Informatics: Dijkstra-Breakthroughs, Glossary (Garbage Collection)'' |publisher=[[University of Klagenfurt]] |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://blog.golang.org/go15gc |author=Hudson, Richard |title=''Go GC: Prioritizing low latency and simplicity'' |publisher= The Go Programming Language Blog |quote= [[Go (programming language)|Go]] is building a [[Garbage collection (computer science)| garbage collection]] (GC) not only for 2015 but for 2025 and beyond: A GC that supports today’s software development and scales along with new software and hardware throughout the next decade. <br/> To create a garbage collector for the next decade, we turned to an algorithm from decades ago. Go's new garbage collector is a concurrent, tri-color, mark-sweep collector, an idea first proposed by Dijkstra in 1978. This is a deliberate divergence from most \"enterprise\" grade garbage collectors of today, and one that we believe is well suited to the properties of modern hardware and the latency requirements of modern software. |date=31 August 2015 |accessdate=21 September 2015 }}</ref>  In the early 1980s Dijkstra and [[Carel S. Scholten]] proposed the [[Dijkstra–Scholten algorithm]] for detecting termination in [[distributed systems]].  In 1981 Dijkstra developed [[smoothsort]], a [[comparison sort|comparison-based]] [[sorting algorithm]] and a variation of [[heapsort]].  ===Compiler construction and programming language research=== Dijkstra was known to be a fan of [[ALGOL|ALGOL 60]], and worked on the team that implemented the first [[compiler]] for that language. He was closely involved in the ALGOL 60 development, realisation and popularisation. As discussed by Peter Naur in the article ‘The European side of the last phase of the development of ALGOL 60’, in the ''Proceedings of the First ACM SIGPLAN Conference on History of Programming Languages'', January 1978, Dijkstra took part in the period 1958–1959 in a number of meetings that culminated in the publication of the report defining the [[ALGOL 60]] language. Dijkstra’s name does not appear in the list of 13 authors of the final report. Apparently, he eventually left the committee because he could not agree with the majority opinions. Still, while at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam), he wrote jointly with [[Jaap Zonneveld]] the first ALGOL 60 compiler. Dijkstra and Zonneveld, who collaborated on the compiler, agreed not to shave until the project was completed; while Zonneveld shaved shortly thereafter, Dijkstra kept his beard for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vanemden.wordpress.com/2008/05/06/i-remember-edsger-dijkstra-1930-2002/ | title=I remember Edsger Dijkstra (1930–2002) | accessdate=22 December 2010 | author=van Emden, Maarten | date=6 May 2008}}</ref> The ALGOL 60 compiler was one of the first to support [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.dijkstrascry.com/node/4 |title=Dijkstra's Rallying Cry for Generalization: the Advent of the Recursive Procedure, late 1950s – early 1960s |last=Daylight |first=E.

Programming as a professional activity was poorly understood in those years. In Dijkstra’s own words:<ref name=\"ewd340\"/> {{quote |What about the poor [[programmer]]? Well, to tell the honest truth: he was hardly noticed. For one thing, the first machines were so bulky that you could hardly move them and besides that, they required such extensive maintenance that it was quite natural that the place where people tried to use the machine was the same laboratory where the machine had been developed. Secondly, his somewhat invisible work was without any glamour: you could show the machine to visitors and that was several orders of magnitude more spectacular than some sheets of coding. But most important of all, the programmer himself had a very modest view of his own work: his work derived all its significance from the existence of that wonderful machine. Because that was a unique machine, he knew only too well that his programs had only local significance and also, because it was patently obvious that this machine would have a limited lifetime, he knew that very little of his work would have a lasting value.}}  In the late 1960s computer programming was in a [[software crisis|state of crisis]]. [[Software crisis]] is a term used in the early days of [[computing science]] for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient [[computer programs]] in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the [[software]], many software problems arose because existing methods were neither sufficient nor up to the mark. The term ‘’software crisis’’ was coined by some attendees at the first [[NATO]] Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at [[Garmisch]], Germany.<ref name=\"Haigh, Thomas 2010\">Haigh, Thomas (2010)</ref><ref name=\"nato\">[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/NATOReports/index.html Report about the NATO Software Engineering Conference dealing with the software crisis]</ref><ref name=\"nato2\">[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1968.PDF Report on a conference sponsored by the NATO SCIENCE COMMITTEE Garmisch, Germany, 7th to 11th October 1968]</ref> [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem: “The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.”<ref name=\"ewd340\"/>  While Dijkstra had programmed extensively in machine code in the 1950s, he came to the conclusion that in high-level languages frequent use of the [[GOTO]] statement was usually symptomatic of poor structure. In 1968 he wrote a private paper \"A Case against the GO TO Statement\",<ref>{{Cite EWD|215|A Case against the GO TO Statement}}</ref> which was then published as a letter in CACM.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dijkstra |first=E. W. |title=Letters to the editor: go to statement considered harmful |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |date=March 1968 |pages=147–148 |issn=0001-0782 |doi=10.1145/362929.362947 }}</ref> Editor [[Niklaus Wirth]] gave this letter the heading \"[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]\", which introduced the phrase \"[[considered harmful]]\" into computing. Dijkstra's thesis was that departures from linear control flow were clearer if allowed only in disciplined higher-level structures such as the [[Conditional (computer programming)|if-then-else]] statement and the [[while loop]].  This methodology was developed into [[structured programming]] movement, the title of his 1972 book, coauthored with [[C.A.R. Hoare]] and [[Ole-Johan Dahl]]. Considered by many as the first significant movement in history of computer programming, structured programming became the new programming orthodoxy during the 1970s.<ref>[[Donald Knuth|Knuth, Donald]] (1974)</ref><ref>Nakagawa, Toru (TRIZ Journal, 2005)</ref>   Dijkstra formulated some of his early ideas about programming as a mathematical discipline starting around the time of publication of his letter (\"[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]\"). He continued to point out that software productivity is closely related to rigor in design, which eliminates software bugs at an early stage. He was particularly impressed by the dimension of the software problem when he attended the famous 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering, which was the first conference devoted to the problem. He became convinced that [[programming methodology]] should become a scientific discipline, and he decided to study how to avoid complexity in software designs.  ===Program design and development (software engineering principles)=== Dijkstra's ideas about [[programming methodology]] helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the professional discipline of [[software engineering]], enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects.<ref>Broy, Manfred; Denert, Ernst (2002)</ref><ref>Henderson, Harry (Facts on File, Inc., 2009)</ref>   Dijkstra sent “Notes on Structured Programming”, later to be one of his seminal works, to a few friends soliciting their comments. This note became a sensation, and major corporations initiated programs based on his ideas to integrate rigorous practices into their programming projects. Dijkstra had advocated certain design principles, which have now become completely accepted in the computer science community: Large systems should be constructed out of many smaller components; each component should be defined only by its interface and not by its implementation; smaller components may be designed following a similar process of decomposition, thus leading to a top-down style of design; the design should start by enumerating the “[[Separation of concerns|separable concerns]]” and by considering each group of concerns independently of the others; and mathematical logic is and must be the basis for software design. This work has had far-reaching impact on all areas of computer science, from teaching of the very first course in programming to the designs of complex software. Mathematical analysis of designs and specifications have become central activities in computer science research.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  [[Separation of concerns]] (SoC), one of the basic principles in [[software engineering]], is a design principle for separating a [[computer program]] into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate [[concern (computer science)|concern]]. The term ''[[separation of concerns]]'' was coined by Dijkstra in his 1974 paper \"On the role of scientific thought\".<ref>{{Cite book   | last = Dijkstra | first = Edsger W | author-link = Edsger W.

It is, that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, all the time knowing that one is occupying oneself only with one of the aspects. We know that a program must be correct and we can study it from that viewpoint only; we also know that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day, so to speak. In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained&nbsp;—on the contrary!— by tackling these various aspects simultaneously.

If you look at early examples of programs, and you can find many in the electronic library of the Computer Society, you will find that most code of that era is complicated, difficult to read, hard to modify, and challenging to reuse. In his 1967 paper, Dijkstra described how software could be constructed in layers and gave an example of a simple operating system that used five layers. He admitted that this system might not be a realistic test of his ideas but he argued that the \"larger the project, the more essential the structuring!\"<br/> The idea of using layers to control complexity has become a mainstay of software architecture. We see it in many forms and apply it to many problems. We see it in the hierarchy of classes in object-oriented programming and in the structure of Service-Oriented Architecture. |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}</ref> His 1968 article on this subject provided the foundation for subsequent designs of the operating systems.   Dijkstra organized the design of the system in layers in order to reduce the overall complexity of the software.

As Brinch Hansen notes, 'Dijkstra lays the conceptual foundation for abstract concurrent programming' with that paper.  In 1968 Dijkstra published his seminal paper ‘Cooperating sequential processes’, a 70-page essay that originated the field of [[concurrent programming]].<ref>McCormick, John W.; Singhoff, Frank; Hugues, Jérôme (2011). ''Building Parallel, Embedded, and Real-Time Applications with Ada'' (Cambridge University Press), p. 5. “The notion of the concurrent program as a means for writing parallel programs without regard for the underlying hardware was first introduced by Edsger Dijkstra (1968). Moti Ben-Ari (1982) elegantly summed up Dijkstra’s idea in three sentences: ‘Concurrent programming is the name given to programming notation and techniques for expressing potential parallelism and solving the resulting synchronization and communication problems. Implementation of parallelism is a topic in computer systems (hardware and software) that is essentially independent of concurrent programming. Concurrent programming is important because it provides an abstract setting in which to study parallelism without getting bogged down in the implementation details.’”</ref> He discussed in it the notion of [[mutual exclusion]] ([[mutex]]) and the criteria a satisfactory solution should satisfy. He also redressed the historical perspective left out of his 1965 paper by including the [[Dekker's algorithm|first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem]], for two processes, due to [[Theodorus Dekker]]. Dijkstra subsequently generalized [[Dekker's algorithm|Dekker's solution]] to n processes.<ref>Anderson, J.H.; Kim, Y.-J.; Herman, T. (2003).

[[File:Dining philosophers.png|thumb|180px|Illustration of the dining philosophers problem]] The [[dining philosophers problem]] is an example problem often used in [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] algorithm design to illustrate [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] issues and techniques for resolving them. It was originally formulated in 1965 by Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers [[resource contention|competing for access]] to [[tape drive]] peripherals. Soon after, [[Tony Hoare]] gave the problem its present formulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf|title=Communicating Sequential Processes|last=Hoare|first=C. A.

Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]. The citation for the prize reads: “The [[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]] is named for Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (1930-2002), a pioneer in the area of distributed computing. His foundational work on concurrency primitives (such as the semaphore), concurrency problems (such as mutual exclusion and deadlock), reasoning about concurrent systems, and self-stabilization comprises one of the most important supports upon which the field of distributed computing is built. No other individual has had a larger influence on research in principles of distributed computing.”</ref><ref>[http://www.eatcs.org/index.php/dijkstra-prize Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing (EATCS International Symposium on Distributed Computing)]</ref> Some of his papers are even considered to be those that established the field. Dijkstra's 1965 paper, ''Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control'' was the first to present the correct solution to the [[mutual exclusion]] problem. [[Leslie Lamport]] writes that this work “started the field of concurrent and [[distributed algorithms]]”.<ref>[http://www.podc.org/influential/2002-influential-paper/ 2002 PODC Influential Paper Award (ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing)]</ref>   In particular, his paper \"Self-stabilizing Systems in Spite of Distributed Control\" (1974) started the sub-field of [[self-stabilization]]. Dijkstra's work was not widely noticed until [[Leslie Lamport]]'s invited talk at the ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] in 1983. In his report on Dijkstra's work on [[self-stabilization|self-stabilizing distributed systems]], Lamport regard it to be 'a milestone in work on fault-tolerance' and 'a very fertile field for research'.<ref>Dolev, Shlomi (2000). ''Self-stabilization''. (MIT Press), p. 3</ref>  In the early 1980s he published two small papers on the [[Dijkstra–Scholten algorithm|problem of detecting termination in distributed systems]]. The first one, four pages long, was written with Carel Scholten; the second, three pages long, with Wim Feijen and Netty van Gasteren.  ===Formal specification and verification===  From the 1970s, Dijkstra's chief interest was [[formal verification]]. The prevailing opinion at the time was that one should first write a program and then provide a [[mathematical proof]] of [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]. Dijkstra objected, noting that the resulting proofs are long and cumbersome and give no insight on how the program was developed. An alternative method is ''[[program derivation]]'', to \"develop proof and program hand in hand\". One starts with a mathematical ''specification'' of what a program is supposed to do and applies mathematical transformations to the specification until it is turned into a program that can be executed. The resulting program is then known to be ''correct by construction''. Much of Dijkstra's later work concerns ways to streamline mathematical argument.  In 1976 Dijkstra published a seminal book, ''A Discipline of Programming'', which put forward his method of systematic development of programs together with their correctness proofs. In his exposition he used his ‘[[Guarded Command Language]]’. The language, with its reliance on non-determinism, the adopted [[weakest precondition]] [[Predicate transformer semantics|semantics]] and the proposed development method has had a considerable impact on the field to this day. The [[refinement calculus]], originally proposed by [[Ralph-Johan Back]]<ref>Back,  Ralph-Johan; Wright, Joakim (1998). ''Refinement Calculus A Systematic Introduction (Texts in Computer Science)''. (Springer)</ref> and developed by [[Carroll Morgan (computer scientist)|Carroll Morgan]],<ref>Morgan, Carroll; Vickers, Trevor (1992). ''On the Refinement Calculus''. (Springer)</ref> is an extension of Dijkstra's [[weakest precondition calculus]], where program statements are modeled as [[Predicate transformer semantics|predicate transformers]].<ref>Back,  Ralph-Johan; Wright, Joakim (1998), p. v</ref>  In 1984, to add further support to this approach to programming, he published jointly with Wim Feijen an introductory textbook for first-year students of computer science. The book, first published in Dutch, was entitled ''Een methode van programmeren''. The English edition appeared in 1988 as ''A Method of Programming''.  Then in 1990 Dijkstra published his book ''Predicate Calculus and Program Semantics'' with [[Carel S. Scholten]]. The book was devoted to logical and mathematical analysis of his [[weakest precondition]] [[Predicate transformer semantics|semantics]] with a long prelude concerning [[weakest precondition calculus|predicate calculus]].  ===On the nature of computer science and computer programming=== Dijkstra wrote a large number of essays on the nature of computer science research and education, on its relationship to the industry and society, and even on the manner in which scientific articles should be written and presented.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  In his 1988 paper ''[[On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science]]'', Dijkstra argues that computer programming should be understood as a branch of mathematics, and that the formal provability of a program is a major criterion for correctness.  In a 2001 interview,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL97C8C53ZM |title=Edsger Dijkstra – Discipline in Thought (visit www.catonmat.net for notes) |publisher=Video.google.com |date= |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> he stated a desire for \"elegance\", whereby the correct approach would be to process thoughts mentally, rather than attempt to render them until they are complete. The analogy he made was to contrast the compositional approaches of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].  Many of his opinions on computer science and programming have become widespread. For example, he coined the programming phrase \"two or more, use a for\",{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} alluding to the rule of thumb that when you find yourself processing more than one instance of a data structure, it is time to consider encapsulating that logic inside a loop.   He was the first to make the claim that programming is so inherently complex that, in order to manage it successfully, programmers need to harness every trick and abstraction possible.   Dijkstra was one of the most famous opponents of the engineering view of computing science. Like [[Peter Naur]] and [[Kristen Nygaard]], Dijkstra dislikes the very term 'computer science'. [[Computer science]], as Dijkstra pointed out, deserves a better name. He suggests it can be called 'computing science'. Instead of the computer, or computing technology, Dijkstra wanted to emphasize the abstract mechanisms that computing science uses to master complexity. When expressing the abstract nature of [[computing science]], he wrote,  :A confusion of even longer standing came from the fact that the unprepared included the [[electronic engineers]] that were supposed to design, build and maintain the machines. The job was actually beyond the [[electronic technology]] of the day, and, as a result, the question of how to get and keep the physical equipment more or less in working condition became in the early days the all-overriding concern. As a result, the topic became – primarily in the USA – prematurely known as ‘[[computer science]]’ – which, actually, is like referring to [[surgery]] as ‘knife science’ – and it was firmly implanted in people’s minds that [[computing science]] is about machines and their peripheral equipment. Quod non [Latin: \"Which is not true\"]. We now know that electronic technology has no more to contribute to [[computing]] than the physical equipment. We now know that [[programmable computer]] is no more and no less than an extremely handy device for realizing any conceivable mechanism without changing a single wire, and that the core challenge for computing science is hence a conceptual one, viz., what (abstract) mechanisms we can conceive without getting lost in the complexities of our own making..<ref>{{cite EWD|924|On a cultural gap}}{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=E.W.|title=On a cultural gap|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|year=1986|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48–52|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD924.html|doi=10.1007/bf03023921}}</ref>  In ''The Humble Programmer'' (1972), Dijkstra wrote: “We must not forget that it is not our [computing scientists'] business to make programs, it is our business to design classes of computations that will display a desired behaviour.”  Dijkstra also opposed the inclusion of [[software engineering]] under the umbrella of academic computer science. He wrote that, “As economics is known as \"The Miserable Science\", software engineering should be known as \"The Doomed Discipline\", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory.” And “software engineering has accepted as its charter \"How to program if you cannot.\".” <ref>{{Cite EWD|1036|On the cruelty of really teaching computer science}}</ref>  ==Character and working style== [[File:Edsger Dijkstra 1994.jpg|thumb |Dijkstra at the blackboard during a conference at [[ETH Zurich]] in 1994]] In the world of computer science, Dijkstra is well-known as a “character”. In the preface of his book ''A Discipline of Programming'' (1976) he stated the following: “For the absence of a bibliography I offer neither explanation nor apology.”. In fact, most of his articles and books have no references at all.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref> This approach to references was deplored by some researchers. But Dijkstra chose this way of working to preserve his self-reliance.  As a university professor for much of his life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavor.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/> His approach to teaching was unconventional.<ref>Irfan Hyder, Syed (2013)</ref>His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra's first language. However the pauses also served as a way for him to think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin had little to do with computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref> At the beginning of each [[semester]] he would take a photo of each of the students, in order to memorize their names. He never followed a [[textbook]], with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students’ solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over a whole week. Each student was examined in Dijkstra’s office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/>  He was also highly original in his way of assessing people’s capacity for a job. When Vladimir Lifschitz came to Austin in 1990 for a job interview, Dijkstra gave him a puzzle. Vladimir solved it and has been working in Austin since then.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref>  Despite having invented much of the technology of software, Dijkstra eschewed the use of computers in his own work for many decades. Even after he succumbed to his UT colleagues’ encouragement and acquired a [[Macintosh]] [[computer]], he used it only for [[e-mail]] and for browsing the [[World Wide Web]].<ref name=\"UTx\">{{Citation | publisher = University of Texas | format = memorial | url = http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2002-2003/memorials/Dijkstra/dijkstra.html | title = In Memoriam Edsger Wybe Dijkstra}}.</ref> Dijkstra never wrote his articles using a computer. He preferred to rely on his [[typewriter]] and later on his Montblanc pen.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R. (2002)</ref> Dijkstra’s favorite writing instrument was the Montblanc Meisterstück [[fountain pen]]. He repeatedly tried other pens, but none ever displaced the Montblanc.   He had no use for [[word processors]], believing that one should be able to write a letter or article without rough drafts, rewriting, or any significant editing. He would work it all out in his head before putting [[pen]] to paper, and once mentioned that when he was a physics student he would solve his homework problems in his head while walking the streets of [[Leiden]].<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/> Most of Dijkstra's publications were written by him alone. He never had a secretary and took care of all his correspondence alone.<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R.

(2002)</ref>  In many of his more humorous essays, Dijkstra described a fictional company of which he served as chairman. The company was called Mathematics, Inc., a company that he imagined having [[commercialized]] the production of mathematical [[theorems]] in the same way that software companies had commercialized the production of computer programs.  He invented a number of activities and challenges of Mathematics Inc. and documented them in several papers in the EWD series. The imaginary company had produced a proof of the [[Riemann Hypothesis]] but then had great difficulties collecting [[royalties]] from mathematicians who had proved results assuming the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof itself was a [[trade secret]].<ref name=\"Cite EWD|475\">{{Cite EWD|475}}</ref> Many of the company's proofs were rushed out the door and then much of the company's effort had to be spent on [[Software maintenance|maintenance]].<ref>{{Cite EWD|539}}</ref> A more successful effort was the Standard Proof for [[Pythagoras' Theorem]], that replaced the more than 100 incompatible existing proofs.<ref>{{Cite EWD |427}}</ref> Dijkstra described Mathematics Inc. as \"the most exciting and most miserable business ever conceived\".<ref name=\"Cite EWD|475\"/> EWD 443 (1974) describes his fictional company as having over 75 percent of the world's market share.<ref>{{Cite EWD|443}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Dijkstra | first = Edsger W | title = Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-387-90652-2 }}</ref>  ==EWDs== Dijkstra was well-known for his habit of carefully composing manuscripts with his [[fountain pen]]. The manuscripts are called EWDs, since Dijkstra numbered them with ''EWD'', his initials, as a prefix. According to Dijkstra himself, the EWDs started when he moved from the Mathematical Centre in [[Amsterdam]] to the Eindhoven University of Technology (then Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven). After going to [[Eindhoven]], Dijkstra experienced a [[writer's block]] for more than a year. Dijkstra distributed photocopies of a new EWD among his colleagues. Many recipients photocopied and forwarded their copies, so the EWDs spread throughout the international computer science community. The topics were computer science and mathematics, and included trip reports, letters, and speeches. These short articles span a period of 40 years. Almost all EWDs appearing after 1972 were hand-written. They are rarely longer than 15 pages and are consecutively numbered. The last one, No. 1318, is from 14 April 2002. Within computer science they are known as the EWD reports, or, simply the EWDs. More than 1300 EWDs have been scanned, with a growing number transcribed to facilitate search, and are available online at the Dijkstra archive of the University of Texas.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = University of Texas | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ | title = Online EWD archive}}.</ref>  ==Lifestyle==  Dijkstra's self-confidence went together with a remarkably modest [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], to the point of being [[:wikt:spartan|spartan]].<ref>Apt, Krzysztof R.

His foundational work on concurrency primitives (such as the semaphore), concurrency problems (such as [[mutual exclusion]] and [[deadlock]]), reasoning about concurrent systems, and [[self-stabilization]] comprises one of the most important supports upon which the field of distributed computing is built. No other individual has had a larger influence on research in principles of distributed computing.}}  Former [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] President [[Peter J. Denning]] wrote about Dijkstra:<ref>Denning, Peter J. (2004). ''The Field of Programmers Myth''. (Communications of the ACM, 47 (7) pp. 15-20)</ref> {{quote |Edsger Dijkstra, one of the giants of our field and a passionate believer in the mathematical view of programs and programming (...) Over the previous quarter-century, he had formulated many of the great intellectual challenges of the field as programming—the goto statement, structured programming, concurrent processes, semaphores, deadlocks, recursive programming in Algol, and deriving correct programs.}}  ==Awards and honors== Among Dijkstra's awards and honors are:<ref name=\"UTx\"/> * Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1971)<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00004832 |title=Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (1930 - 2002) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> * Distinguished Fellow of the [[British Computer Society]] (1971) * The [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s [[A.M.

On the occasion of Dijkstra’s 60th birthday in 1990, The Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin organized a two-day seminar in his honor. Speakers came from all over the United States and Europe, and a group of computer scientists contributed research articles which were edited into a book.<ref name=\"Dijkstra_bio\"/><ref>Feijen, W.; van Gasteren, A.J.M.; Gries, D.; Misra, J. (eds.): ''Beauty Is Our Business: A Birthday Salute to Edsger W. Dijkstra''. (Springer)</ref>  In 2002, the C&C Foundation of Japan recognized Dijkstra “for his pioneering contributions to the establishment of the scientific basis for computer software through creative research in basic software theory, algorithm theory, structured programming, and semaphores.” Dijkstra was alive to receive notice of the award, but it was accepted by his family in an award ceremony after his death.  Shortly before his death in 2002, Dijkstra received the ACM [[PODC Influential-Paper Award]] in [[distributed computing]] for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the [[Dijkstra Prize]] ([[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]]) the following year, in his honor.  The Dijkstra Award for Outstanding Academic Achievement in Computer Science ([[Loyola University Chicago]], Department of Computer Science) is named for Edger W. Dijkstra. Beginning in 2005, this award recognizes the top academic performance by a graduating computer science major. Selection is based on GPA in all major courses and election by department faculty.<ref>[http://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/awards/ Awards: Loyola University Chicago]</ref>  The Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin hosted the inaugural Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture on October 12, 2010. [[Tony Hoare]], Emeritus Professor at Oxford and Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, was the speaker for the event. This lecture series was made possible by a generous grant from Schlumberger to honor the memory of Dijkstra.  ==See also== * [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] * [[Dining philosophers problem]] * [[Guarded Command Language]]  * [[Predicate transformer semantics]] * [[Weakest precondition calculus]] * [[Semaphore (programming)|Semaphore]] * [[Smoothsort]] * ''[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]'' * ''[[On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science]]'' * [[List of pioneers in computer science]] * [[List of important publications in computer science]] * [[List of important publications in theoretical computer science]] * [[List of important publications in concurrent, parallel, and distributed computing]]  ==Bibliography==  ===Primary sources=== Books: * Dijkstra, Edsger W.: ''A Primer of ALGOL 60 Programming: Together with Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60''.

         "{{tone|date=March 2012}} [[Perennialist]]s believe that one should teach the things that one deems to be of everlasting pertinence to all people everywhere. They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques. Since people are people first, and workers second if at all, one should teach liberal topics first, not vocational topics.  A particular strategy with modern perennialists is to teach scientific reasoning, not facts. They may illustrate the reasoning with original accounts of famous experiments. This gives the students a human side to the science, and shows the reasoning in action. Most importantly, it shows the uncertainty and false steps of real science.  Although perennialism may appear similar to [[educational essentialism|essentialism]], perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based. Both philosophies are typically considered to be [[teacher]]-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as [[educational progressivism|progressivism]]. However, since the teachers associated with perennialism are in a sense the authors of the Western masterpieces themselves, these teachers may be open to student criticism through the associated [[Socratic method]], which, if carried out as true dialogue, is a balance between students, including the teacher promoting the discussion.  ==Secular perennialism== The word perennial in secular perennialism suggests something that lasts an indefinitely long time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. As promoted primarily by [[Robert Hutchins]] and [[Mortimer Adler]], a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings is recommended.  This form of perennialism comprises the [[Humanism|humanist]] and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the [[University of Chicago]], where they still strongly influence the curriculum in the form of the undergraduate Common Core.  Other notable figures in the movement include [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] (who together initiated the [[Great Books]] program at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in Annapolis, Maryland), [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Alexander Meiklejohn]], and Sir [[Richard Livingstone]], an English [[Classicism|classicist]] with an American following.  Secular perennialists espouse the idea that education should focus on the historical development of a continually developing common western base of human knowledge and art, the timeless value of classic thought on central human issues by landmark thinkers, and revolutionary ideas critical to historical western [[paradigm shift]]s or changes in world view. A program of studies which is highly general, nonspecialized, and nonvocational is advocated.<ref>Paul D. Travers and Ronald W. Rebore: ''Foundations of Education, Becoming a Teacher'', Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1990, p. 66</ref> They firmly believe that exposure of all citizens to the development of thought by those most responsible for the evolution of the Western tradition is integral to the survival of the freedoms, human rights and responsibilities inherent to a true Democracy.  Adler states: <blockquote> ... our political democracy depends upon the reconstitution of our schools. Our schools are not turning out young people prepared for the high office and the duties of citizenship in a democratic republic. Our political institutions cannot thrive, they may not even survive, if we do not produce a greater number of thinking citizens, from whom some statesmen of the type we had in the 18th century might eventually emerge. We are, indeed, a nation at risk, and nothing but radical reform of our schools can save us from impending disaster... Whatever the price... the price we will pay for not doing it will be much greater.<ref>Mortimer J. Adler: Reforming [http://radicalacademy.com/adlerreformedu.htm Education — No Quick Fix], ''The Radical Academy''</ref> </blockquote>  Hutchins writes in the same vein: <blockquote> The business of saying ... that people are not capable of achieving a good education is too strongly reminiscent of the opposition of every extension of democracy. This opposition has always rested on the allegation that the people were incapable of exercising the power they demanded. Always the historic statement has been verified: you cannot expect the slave to show the virtues of the free man unless you first set him free. When the slave has been set free, he has, in the passage of time, become indistinguishable from those who have always been free ... There appears to be an innate human tendency to underestimate the capacity of those who do not belong to \"our\" group. Those who do not share our background cannot have our ability. Foreigners, people who are in a different economic status, and the young seem invariably to be regarded as intellectually backward ...<ref name=\"Hutchins\">Robert Maynard Hutchins: ''Great Books: The Foundation of a Liberal Education'', Simon & Schuster, New York, 1954</ref> </blockquote>  As with the [[Educational essentialism|essentialists]], perennialists are educationally conservative in the requirement of a curriculum focused upon fundamental subject areas, but stress that the overall aim should be exposure to history's finest thinkers as models for discovery.  The student should be taught such basic subjects as English, languages, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and fine arts.<ref>George F. Kneller: ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Education'', John Wiley & Sons, 1971</ref> Adler states: \"The three R's, which always signified the formal disciplines, are the essence of liberal or general education.\"<ref>Adler: op. cit., p. 62</ref>  Secular perennialists agree with [[Educational progressivism|progressivists]] that memorization of vast amounts of factual information and a focus on second-hand information in textbooks and lectures does not develop rational thought. They advocate learning through the development of meaningful conceptual thinking and judgement by means of a directed reading list of the profound, aesthetic, and meaningful [[great books]] of the [[Western canon]]. These books, secular perennialists argue, are written by the world's finest thinkers, and cumulatively comprise the \"[[Great Conversation]]\" of mankind with regard to the central human questions. Their basic argument for the use of original works (abridged translations being acceptable as well) is that these are the products of \"[[genius]]\". Hutchins remarks:  <blockquote>Great books are great teachers; they are showing us every day what ordinary people are capable of. These books come out of ignorant, inquiring humanity. They are usually the first announcements for success in learning. Most of them were written for, and addressed to, ordinary people.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/></blockquote>  It is important to note that the Great Conversation is not static, which is the impression that one might obtain from some descriptions of perennialism, a confusion with religious perennialism, or even the term perennialism itself.  The Great Conversation and the set of related great books changes as the representative thought of man changes or progresses, and is therefore representative of an evolution of thought, but is not based upon the whim or fancy of the latest cultural fads.  Hutchins makes this point very clear:  <blockquote> In the course of history... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation. ...the West needs to recapture and reemphasize and bring to bear upon its present problems the wisdom that lies in the works of its greatest thinkers and in the discussion that they have carried on.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  Perennialism was a solution proposed in response to what was considered by many to be a failing educational system. Again Hutchins writes:  <blockquote> The products of American high schools are illiterate; and a degree from a famous college or university is no guarantee that the graduate is in any better case. One of the most remarkable features of American society is that the difference between the \"uneducated\" and the \"educated\" is so slight.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  In this regard [[John Dewey]] and Hutchins were in agreement. Hutchins's book ''The Higher Learning in America'' deplored the \"plight of higher learning\" that had turned away from cultivation of the intellect and toward anti-intellectual practicality due in part, to a lust for money. In a highly negative review of the book, Dewey wrote a series of articles in ''The Social Frontier'' which began by applauding Hutchins' attack on \"the aimlessness of our present educational scheme.<ref>Thomas Erlich: \"Dewey versus Hutchins: The Next Round,\" ''Education and Democracy: Re-imagining Liberal Learning in America'', ed. Robert Orril, College Entrance Examination Board, New York, 1997</ref>  Perennialists believe that reading is to be supplemented with mutual investigations (between the teacher and the student) and minimally-directed discussions through the [[Socratic method]] in order to develop a historically oriented understanding of concepts. They argue that accurate, independent reasoning distinguishes the developed or educated mind and they thus stress the development of this faculty. A skilled teacher would keep discussions on topic and correct errors in reasoning, but it would be the class, not the teacher, who would reach the conclusions.  While not directing or leading the class to a conclusion, the teacher may work to accurately formulate problems within the scope of the texts being studied.  While the standard argument for utilizing a modern text supports distillation of information into a form relevant to modern society, perennialists argue that many of the historical debates and the development of ideas presented by the great books are relevant to any society, at any time, and thus that the suitability of the great books for instructional use is unaffected by their age.  Perennialists freely acknowledge that any particular selection of great books will disagree on many topics; however, they see this as an advantage, rather than a detriment. They believe that the student must learn to recognize such disagreements, which often reflect current debates. The student becomes responsible for thinking about the disagreements and reaching a reasoned, defensible conclusion. This is a major goal of the Socratic discussions. They do not advocate teaching a settled scholarly interpretation of the books, which would cheat the student of the opportunity to learn rational criticism and to know his own mind.  ==Religious perennialism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of education]] --> Perennialism was originally religious in nature, developed first by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the thirteenth century in his work ''[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer11.htm De Magistro]'' (''The Teacher'').  In the nineteenth century, [[John Henry Newman]] presented a detailed defense of educational perennialism in ''The Idea of a University''.  Discourse 5 of that work, \"[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/idea/discourse5.html Knowledge Its Own End]\", is still relevant as a clear statement of a Christian educational perennialism.  There are several epistemological options, which affect the pedagogical options.  The possibilities may be surveyed by considering four extreme positions, as indicated in the following table: {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"25\" cellpadding=\"25\" align=\"center\" |- ! Idealistic Rationalism ! Realistic Rationalism |-  ! Idealistic Fideism !

This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}</ref><ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /><ref name=\"Hyponatremia\" /> * [[Hyperthermia]]<ref name=\"pmid22392347\" /><ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /><ref name=\"Hyponatremia\" /> * [[Bruxism]] (grinding and clenching of the teeth)<ref name=\"current perspectives\" /><ref name=\"pmid22392347\" /><ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /> * Increased wakefulness or [[insomnia]]<ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /> * Increased perspiration and sweating<ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /><ref name=\"Hyponatremia\" /> * Increased [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]]<ref name=\"pmid22392347\" /><ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /><ref name=\"Hyponatremia\" /> {{multicol-break}} * Loss of [[appetite]]<ref name=\"Toxnet MDMA\" /> * Nausea and vomiting<ref name=\"current perspectives\" /> * [[Diarrhea]]<ref name=\"Acute amph toxicity\" /> * [[Erectile dysfunction]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spauwen|first1=L.

Köllisch developed a preparation of a hydrastinine [[chemical analogue|analogue]], methylhydrastinine, at the request of his coworkers, Walther Beckh and Otto Wolfes.

History of MDMA}}</ref> In 1927, Max Oberlin studied the pharmacology of MDMA while searching for substances with effects similar to [[adrenaline]] or [[ephedrine]], the latter being structurally similar to MDMA. Compared to ephedrine, Oberlin observed that it had similar effects on [[vascular smooth muscle]] tissue, stronger effects at the uterus, and no \"local effect at the eye\". MDMA was also found to have effects on [[blood sugar]] levels comparable to high doses of ephedrine. Oberlin concluded that the effects of MDMA were not limited to the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Research was stopped \"particularly due to a strong price increase of safrylmethylamine\", which was still used as an intermediate in methylhydrastinine synthesis. Albert van Schoor performed simple toxicological tests with the drug in 1952, most likely while researching new stimulants or circulatory medications. After pharmacological studies, research on MDMA was not continued. In 1959, Wolfgang Fruhstorfer synthesized MDMA for pharmacological testing while researching stimulants. It is unclear if Fruhstorfer investigated the effects of MDMA in humans.<ref name=\"pmid17152992\"/>  Outside of Merck, other researchers began to investigate MDMA.

In general, the unlicensed use, sale or manufacture of MDMA are all criminal offences.  In Australia, MDMA was declared illegal in 1986 because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse. It is classed as a [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Schedule 9 Prohibited Substance]] in the country, meaning it is available for scientific research purposes only. Any other type of sale, use or manufacture is strictly prohibited by law. Permits for research uses on humans must be approved by a recognized [[ethics committee]] on human research.  In the United Kingdom, MDMA is illegal under a 1977 modification to the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]<ref name=\"UK legality\"/> thereby making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess the drug without a licence. Penalties include a maximum of seven years and/or unlimited fine for possession; life and/or unlimited fine for production or trafficking.  In the United States, MDMA is currently placed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.<ref>''Schedules of Controlled Substances; Scheduling of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act; Remand'', 53 Fed.

It is the [[flag]] and emblem of the [[European Union]] (EU).<ref>It is termed \"Flag of Europe\" or \"European Flag\" by both organisations, intended to represent the continent as a whole, but has no legal basis beyond use by the CoE. It is also known as the \"flag of the European Union\" excluding its relation to the CoE but the term \"flag of the Council of Europe\" is never used.</ref> It is also often used to indicate [[eurozone]] countries, and, more loosely, to represent the continent of Europe or the countries of Europe independent of any of these institutions. The number of stars does not vary according to the member states as they are intended to represent all the peoples of Europe, even those outside the EU.<ref>{{citation|title=EUROPA – The EU at a glance – The symbols of the European Union – The European Flag|accessdate=24 December 2011|url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/emblem/index_en.htm}}</ref>  The flag was designed in  1955 for the [[Council of Europe]] as its symbol, and the CoE urged it to be adopted by other organisations. In 1985 the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), adopted it as its own flag (having had no flag of its own before) at the initiative of the [[European Parliament]].  The flag is not mentioned in the [[Treaties of the European Union|EU's treaties]], its incorporation being dropped along with the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], but it is formally adopted in law. In order to avoid confusion with the European Union, the Council of Europe uses a modified version with a lower-case \"e\" in the centre of the stars which is referred to as the \"Council of Europe Logo\".  Since its adoption by the European Union it has become more associated with the EU due to the EU's higher profile and heavy usage of the emblem.

The national [[flag of Cape Verde]] also shows similarity to the flag of the European Union. The flag is made of a circular formation of ten yellow stars on a dark blue background and a band of white and red.  The stars represent the main islands of the nation (a chain of islands off the coast of West Africa). The blue represents the ocean and the sky. The band of white and red represents the road toward the construction of the nation, and the colours stand for peace (white) and effort (red).  The flag was adopted on 22 September 1992.  Other labels take reference to the European flag such as the [[Organic certification#Europe|EU organic food label]] that uses the twelve stars but reorders them into the shape of a leaf on a green background. The original logo of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] used the twelve stars on a blue background adding ray beams to connect the countries.  == Marian interpretation == {{further|Crown of Immortality|Circle of stars}} {{multiple image | align     = right | image1    = Statue of Virgin Strasbourg.jpg | width1    = 165 | caption1  = Statue of the Blessed Virgin in [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] (1859) | image2    = Virgen estrasburgo UE.jpg | width2    = 210 | caption2  = ''Blessing Madonna'', the stained glass window donated by the Council of Europe to [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] in 1956.<ref name=\"Economist religious\">{{cite web|title=The European Commission and religious values|work=The Economist|date=28 October 2004|url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=3332056|accessdate=4 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Large full version of the window |publisher=venez-chez-domi.fr |url=http://www.venez-chez-domi.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/32-abside-notre-dame-de-strasbourggrande.jpg |accessdate=28 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090227042738/http://www.venez-chez-domi.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/32-abside-notre-dame-de-strasbourggrande.jpg |archivedate=27 February 2009 }}</ref> }} in 1987, following the adoption of the flag by the EEC, Arsène Heitz (1908–1989), one of the designers who had submitted proposals for the flag's design, suggested a religious inspiration for it.

G. Levy and the recent reconstruction by Susan Hood, crediting Arsène Heitz with the original design still seems to me the soundest option.  In particular, Arsène Heitz himself, in 1987, laid claim to his own role in designing the flag and to its religious inspiration when he said that 'the flag of Europe is the flag of Our Lady' [''Magnificat'' magazine, 1987] Secondly, it is worth noting the testimony of  Father Pierre Caillon, who refers to a meeting with Arsène Heitz. Caillon tells of having met the former Council of Europe employee by chance in August 1987 at Lisieux in front of the Carmelite monastery. It was Heitz who stopped him and declared 'I was the one who designed the European flag. I suddenly had the idea of putting the 12 stars of the Miraculous Medal of the Rue du Bac on a blue field. My proposal was adopted unanimously on 8 December 1955, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. I am telling you this, Father, because you are wearing the little blue cross of the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima'\"</ref>  The French satirical magazine ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'' reacted to Heitz's statement with an article entitled ''L’Europe violée par la Sainte Vierge'' (\"Europe Raped by the Blessed Virgin\") in the 20 December 1989 edition. Heitz also made a connection to the date of the flag's adoption, 8 December 1955, coinciding  with the Catholic [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].  [[Paul M. G. Lévy]], then Director of Information at the Council of Europe responsible for designing the flag, in a 1989 statement maintained that he had not been aware of any religious connotations.<ref>{{citation|title=European Union: Myths on the flag|origyear=1995|year=2002|publisher=[[Flags Of The World]]|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/eu!myt.html|accessdate=4 August 2007}} \"While Count Coudenhove-Kalergi in a personal statement maintained that three leading Catholics within the Council had subconciously chosen the twelve stars on the model of Apocalypse 12:1, Paul M.G.

To the question \"Who really designed the flag?\" Lévy replied: :\"I did, and I calculated the proportions to be used for the geometric design. Arsène Heitz, who was an employee in the mail service, put in all sorts of proposals, including the 15-star design. But he submitted too many designs. He wanted to do the European currencies with 15 stars in the corner. He wanted to do national flags incorporating the Council of Europe flag.\"<ref name=\"Gialdino\"/> Carlo Curti Gialdino (2005) has reconstructed  the design process to the effect that Heitz's proposal contained varying numbers of stars, from which the version with twelve stars was chosen by the Committee of Ministers meeting at Deputy level in January 1955 as one out of two remaining candidate designs.<ref name=\"Gialdino\"/>  Lévy's 1998 interview apparently gave rise to a new variant of the \"Marian\" anecdote.

It is based on the final [[Movement (music)|movement]] of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] composed in 1823, and is played on official occasions by both organisations.  ==History== [[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]]]  ===Origin=== {{Main|Ode to Joy|Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)}} [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote the poem ''[[Ode to Joy|An die Freude]]'' (''To Joy'') in 1785 as a \"celebration of the brotherhood of man\".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xJiPF-PPodwC&pg=PA267&dq=%22An+die+Freude%22+trinklieder&sig=ACfU3U1eTzAkIDNnekETPgc_6SjC--6Sqw#PPA268,M1|title=Max Rudolf the Dog, a Musical Life: Writings and Letters|author1=Max Rudolf |author2=Michael Stern |author3=Hanny Bleeker White|year=2001|publisher=Pendragon Press|pages=267–268|accessdate=2008-07-10}}</ref> In later life, the poet was contemptuous of this popularity and dismissed the poem as typical of \"the bad taste of the age\" in which it had been written.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?pg=PA221&dq=ode-to-joy+schiller+bad-poem&lr=lang_en&id=umgoAAAAMAAJ|title=Correspondence of Schiller with Körner|author=Schiller and [[Christian Gottfried Körner|Körner]]; Leonard Simpson|year=1849|publisher=Richard Bentley, London|page=221|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> After Schiller's death, the poem provided the words for the choral movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]].  ===Adoption=== In 1971 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] decided to propose adopting the prelude to the ''[[Ode To Joy]]'' from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] as the European anthem, taking up a suggestion made by [[Count Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] in 1955.<ref>[http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Historical_Content/hymn/kalergi1.pdf Letter to Paul Levy, 3 August 1955]  {{wayback|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Historical_Content/hymn/kalergi1.pdf |date=20090402165322 }}</ref> Beethoven was generally seen as the natural choice for a European anthem. The [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]] officially announced the European Anthem on 19 January 1972 at Strasbourg: the prelude to \"The Ode to Joy\", 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th symphony. In 1974 the same piece of music was adopted as the [[National Anthem of Rhodesia]].  Conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] was asked to write three instrumental arrangements – for solo piano, for wind instruments and for symphony orchestra and he conducted the performance used to make the official recording. He wrote his decisions on the score, notably those concerning the tempo. Karajan decided on [[Half note|minim]] (half note) = 80 whereas Beethoven had written [[Quarter note|crotchet]] (quarter note) = 120.  The anthem was launched via a major information campaign on [[Europe Day]] in 1972. In 1985, it was adopted by EU heads of State and government as the official anthem of the then European Community – since 1993 the European Union. It is not intended to replace the national anthems of the Member States but rather to celebrate the values they all share and their unity in diversity. It expresses the ideals of a united Europe: freedom, peace, and solidarity.<ref>[http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp Emblems], Council of Europe web site</ref>  ===Recent events=== It was to have been included in the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] along with the other [[European symbols]]; however, the treaty failed ratification and was replaced by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which does not include any symbols.<ref name=\"Parl use\">{{cite web|last=Beunderman|first=Mark|title=MEPs defy member states on EU symbols|publisher=EU Observer|date=11 July 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24464|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> A declaration was attached to the treaty, in which sixteen member states formally recognised the proposed symbols.<ref name=\"lisbon-symbols-declaration\">[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:0231:0271:EN:PDF Official Journal of the European Union, 2007 C 306–2, p. 267]</ref> In response, the [[European Parliament]] decided that it would make greater use of the anthem, for example at official occasions.<ref name=\"Parl use\"/> In October 2008, the Parliament changed its rules of procedure to have the anthem played at the opening of Parliament after elections and at formal sittings.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lucia|last=Kubosova|title=No prolonged mandate for Barroso, MEPs warn|publisher=[[EU Observer]]|date=9 October 2008|url=http://euobserver.com/9/26899|accessdate=2008-10-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081010125604/http://euobserver.com/9/26899| archivedate= 10 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  ==Usage== [[File:Friedrich schiller.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote ''An die Freude'' which became the basis for Beethoven's composition. However, in the European anthem the [[German language|German]] words were dropped so as not to elevate one language over another.]] \"Ode to Joy\" is the anthem of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Union]], promoted as a symbol for the whole of Europe as are the other [[European symbols]]. It is used on occasions such as [[Europe Day]] and formal events such as the signing of treaties. The European Parliament seeks to make greater use of the music, then-[[President of the European Parliament|Parliament President]] [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]] stated he was moved when the anthem was played for him on his visit to [[Israel]] and ought to be used in Europe more often.<ref name=\"Parl use\"/>  In 2008 it was used by [[Kosovo]] as [[National anthem of Kosovo|its national anthem]] until it adopted its own, and it was played at [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|its declaration of independence]], as a nod to the EU's role in its independence from Serbia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-02-17-kosovo-independence_N.htm |title=Kosovo declares independence - USATODAY.com |work=USA Today |date =17 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-12 }}</ref>  At the 2007 [[Signing of the Treaty of Lisbon|signing ceremony]] for the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], the [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] of the European Union's twenty-seven Member States stood in attendance while the Ode to Joy was played and a choir of 26 Portuguese children sang the original German lyrics.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljK58EK8vxI&feature=PlayList&p=90448697B15657E1&index=0&playnext=1 Signing Ceremony of the Treaty of Lisnon – Part 1 on www.YouTube.com]</ref>  In 1992 the anthem was used by [[CIS national football team]] at the [[UEFA Euro 1992|1992 UEFA European Football Championship]].  On 4 October 2010 the anthem was used when a European team beat a team representing the United States of America to win the [[Ryder Cup]] golf tournament. The European Ryder Cup captain [[Colin Montgomerie]] decided to break with tradition and play the European anthem by itself instead of the individual anthems from participating European nations. It was similarly employed at the 2014 Ryder Cup prizegiving ceremony on 28 September, after Europe had beaten America under its captain, [[Paul McGinley]].  \"Ode to Joy\" is used as the theme song to the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|2016 UEFA Euro qualifying]] football competition at the introduction of every match.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fgdXBEhNNc|title = European Qualifiers Intro - UEFA EURO 2016|date = |accessdate = 14 June 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>  \"Ode to Joy\" , automatically orchestrated in seven different styles, has been used on 18 June 2015 during the ceremony celebrating the 5000th ERC grantee as anthem of the [[European Research Council]] to represent achievements of European research.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buXqNqBFd6E|title = Ode to Joy orchestrated in different styles by Flow Machines|date = |accessdate = 23 June 2016|website = YouTube|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>  ==Unofficial lyrics== Due to the large number of languages used in the European Union, the anthem is purely instrumental, and the German lyrics that [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote and on which Beethoven based [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|the melody]] upon have no official status. Despite this, the German lyrics are often sung by choirs or ordinary people when the anthem is played: for example, at the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004 enlargement on the German-Polish border]], the crowd watching the ceremony playing the music sang along with the German lyrics.  Aside from this, several translations of the poem used by Beethoven as well as original works have attempted to provide lyrics to the anthem in various languages. Versions of the anthem including lyrics have been sung outside official EU occasions.  In France, several adaptations of Beethoven's Ode were known long before the onset of European Union. A version by the librettist Maurice Bouchor (1855–1929) entitled ''Hymn to the Universal Humanity'' (''[[:s:fr:Hymne à l'universelle humanité|Hymne à l'universelle humanité]]'') adding several verses to a preceding version of Jean Ruault, was published. This version and another by Maurice Bouchor, published with Julien Thiersot under the title ''Hymn for future times'' (''Hymne des temps futurs'') in a music book which was widespread among basic schools,<ref>''Chants populaires pour les écoles'', librairie Hachette, published in several editions between 1902 and 1911</ref> is performed unofficially by school choirs during European events. Another version by the Catholic writer Joseph Folliet (1903–1972) is also known.  ===Ode to Joy original lyrics===  {{Col-float}} :'''\"An die Freude\"''' :''German lyrics by Friedrich Schiller''  {{lang|de|<poem> :Freude schöner Götterfunken :Tochter aus Elysium, :Wir betreten feuertrunken, :Himmlische, dein Heiligtum! :Deine Zauber binden wieder :Was die Mode streng geteilt; :Alle Menschen werden Brüder, :Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.  :Wem der große Wurf gelungen, :Eines Freundes Freund zu sein; :Wer ein holdes Weib errungen, :Mische seinen Jubel ein! :Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele :Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund! :Und wer's nie gekonnt, der stehle :Weinend sich aus diesem Bund!  :Freude trinken alle Wesen :An den Brüsten der Natur; :Alle Guten, alle Bösen :Folgen ihrer Rosenspur. :Küsse gab sie uns und Reben, :Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod; :Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben, :und der Cherub steht vor Gott.  :Froh, :wie seine Sonnen fliegen :Durch des Himmels prächt'gen Plan, :Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn, :Freudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen.  :Seid umschlungen, Millionen! :Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt! :Brüder, über'm Sternenzelt :Muß ein lieber Vater wohnen. :Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen? :Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt? :Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt! :Über Sternen muß er wohnen. </poem>}}  {{Col-float-break}}  :'''\"Ode to Joy\"''' :''Translation in English''  <poem> :Joy, bright spark of divinity, :Daughter of Elysium, :Fire-inspired we tread, :Thy Heavenly, thy sanctuary. :Thy magic power re-unites :All that custom has divided, :All men become brothers :Under the sway of thy gentle wings.  :Whoever has created  :An abiding friendship, :Or has won a true and loving wife, :Join in our song of praise, :Yes, all who can call at least one soul  :Theirs upon this earth; :But any who cannot must creep tearfully :Away from our circle.  :All creatures drink of joy :At nature's breast. :Just and unjust :Alike taste of her gift; :She gave us kisses and the fruit of the vine, :A tried friend to the end. :Even the worm can feel contentment, :And the cherub stands before God!  :Gladly,  :As His heavenly bodies fly :On their courses through the heavens, :Thus, brothers, you should run your race, :As a hero going to conquest.  :You millions, I embrace you. :This kiss is for all the world! :Brothers, above the starry canopy :There must dwell a loving Father. :Do you fall in worship, you millions? :World, do you know your creator? :Seek him in the heavens; :Above the stars must He dwell. </poem> {{Col-float-end}}  ==See also== * [[National symbols]] * [[European symbols]] ** [[Flag of Europe]]  ==Notes== {{Reflist|2}}  ==External links== {{Wikisource|Ode to Joy}} {{Commons category|Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)}} * [http://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/078124.html Beethoven's Ninth: A Political History], Esteban Buch (Trans.

The [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]] officially announced the European Anthem on 19 January 1972 at Strasbourg: the prelude to \"The Ode to Joy\", 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven\\'s 9th symphony. In 1974 the same piece of music was adopted as the [[National Anthem of Rhodesia]].  Conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] was asked to write three instrumental arrangements – for solo piano, for wind instruments and for symphony orchestra and he conducted the performance used to make the official recording. He wrote his decisions on the score, notably those concerning the tempo. Karajan decided on [[Half note|minim]] (half note) = 80 whereas Beethoven had written [[Quarter note|crotchet]] (quarter note) = 120.  The anthem was launched via a major information campaign on [[Europe Day]] in 1972. In 1985, it was adopted by EU heads of State and government as the official anthem of the then European Community – since 1993 the European Union. It is not intended to replace the national anthems of the Member States but rather to celebrate the values they all share and their unity in diversity.

Despite this, the German lyrics are often sung by choirs or ordinary people when the anthem is played: for example, at the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004 enlargement on the German-Polish border]], the crowd watching the ceremony playing the music sang along with the German lyrics.  Aside from this, several translations of the poem used by Beethoven as well as original works have attempted to provide lyrics to the anthem in various languages. Versions of the anthem including lyrics have been sung outside official EU occasions.  In France, several adaptations of Beethoven\\'s Ode were known long before the onset of European Union. A version by the librettist Maurice Bouchor (1855–1929) entitled \\'\\'Hymn to the Universal Humanity\\'\\' (\\'\\'[[:s:fr:Hymne à l\\'universelle humanité|Hymne à l\\'universelle humanité]]\\'\\') adding several verses to a preceding version of Jean Ruault, was published. This version and another by Maurice Bouchor, published with Julien Thiersot under the title \\'\\'Hymn for future times\\'\\' (\\'\\'Hymne des temps futurs\\'\\') in a music book which was widespread among basic schools,<ref>\\'\\'Chants populaires pour les écoles\\'\\', librairie Hachette, published in several editions between 1902 and 1911</ref> is performed unofficially by school choirs during European events. Another version by the Catholic writer Joseph Folliet (1903–1972) is also known.  ===Ode to Joy original lyrics===  {{Col-float}} :\\'\\'\\'\"An die Freude\"\\'\\'\\' :\\'\\'German lyrics by Friedrich Schiller\\'\\'  {{lang|de|<poem> :Freude schöner Götterfunken :Tochter aus Elysium, :Wir betreten feuertrunken, :Himmlische, dein Heiligtum! :Deine Zauber binden wieder :Was die Mode streng geteilt; :Alle Menschen werden Brüder, :Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.  :Wem der große Wurf gelungen, :Eines Freundes Freund zu sein; :Wer ein holdes Weib errungen, :Mische seinen Jubel ein! :Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele :Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund! :Und wer\\'s nie gekonnt, der stehle :Weinend sich aus diesem Bund!  :Freude trinken alle Wesen :An den Brüsten der Natur; :Alle Guten, alle Bösen :Folgen ihrer Rosenspur. :Küsse gab sie uns und Reben, :Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod; :Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben, :und der Cherub steht vor Gott.  :Froh, :wie seine Sonnen fliegen :Durch des Himmels prächt\\'gen Plan, :Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn, :Freudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen.  :Seid umschlungen, Millionen! :Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt! :Brüder, über\\'m Sternenzelt :Muß ein lieber Vater wohnen. :Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen? :Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt? :Such\\' ihn über\\'m Sternenzelt! :Über Sternen muß er wohnen. </poem>}}  {{Col-float-break}}  :\\'\\'\\'\"Ode to Joy\"\\'\\'\\' :\\'\\'Translation in English\\'\\'  <poem> :Joy, bright spark of divinity, :Daughter of Elysium, :Fire-inspired we tread, :Thy Heavenly, thy sanctuary. :Thy magic power re-unites :All that custom has divided, :All men become brothers :Under the sway of thy gentle wings.  :Whoever has created  :An abiding friendship, :Or has won a true and loving wife, :Join in our song of praise, :Yes, all who can call at least one soul  :Theirs upon this earth; :But any who cannot must creep tearfully :Away from our circle.  :All creatures drink of joy :At nature\\'s breast. :Just and unjust :Alike taste of her gift; :She gave us kisses and the fruit of the vine, :A tried friend to the end. :Even the worm can feel contentment, :And the cherub stands before God!  :Gladly,  :As His heavenly bodies fly :On their courses through the heavens, :Thus, brothers, you should run your race, :As a hero going to conquest.  :You millions, I embrace you. :This kiss is for all the world! :Brothers, above the starry canopy :There must dwell a loving Father. :Do you fall in worship, you millions? :World, do you know your creator? :Seek him in the heavens; :Above the stars must He dwell. </poem> {{Col-float-end}}  ==See also== * [[National symbols]] * [[European symbols]] ** [[Flag of Europe]]  ==Notes== {{Reflist|2}}  ==External links== {{Wikisource|Ode to Joy}} {{Commons category|Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)}} * [http://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/078124.html Beethoven\\'s Ninth: A Political History], Esteban Buch (Trans.

       "    '{{tone|date=March 2012}} [[Perennialist]]s believe that one should teach the things that one deems to be of everlasting pertinence to all people everywhere. They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques. Since people are people first, and workers second if at all, one should teach liberal topics first, not vocational topics.  A particular strategy with modern perennialists is to teach scientific reasoning, not facts. They may illustrate the reasoning with original accounts of famous experiments. This gives the students a human side to the science, and shows the reasoning in action. Most importantly, it shows the uncertainty and false steps of real science.  Although perennialism may appear similar to [[educational essentialism|essentialism]], perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based. Both philosophies are typically considered to be [[teacher]]-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as [[educational progressivism|progressivism]]. However, since the teachers associated with perennialism are in a sense the authors of the Western masterpieces themselves, these teachers may be open to student criticism through the associated [[Socratic method]], which, if carried out as true dialogue, is a balance between students, including the teacher promoting the discussion.  ==Secular perennialism== The word perennial in secular perennialism suggests something that lasts an indefinitely long time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. As promoted primarily by [[Robert Hutchins]] and [[Mortimer Adler]], a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings is recommended.  This form of perennialism comprises the [[Humanism|humanist]] and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the [[University of Chicago]], where they still strongly influence the curriculum in the form of the undergraduate Common Core.  Other notable figures in the movement include [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] (who together initiated the [[Great Books]] program at [[St. John\\'s College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John\\'s College]] in Annapolis, Maryland), [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Alexander Meiklejohn]], and Sir [[Richard Livingstone]], an English [[Classicism|classicist]] with an American following.  Secular perennialists espouse the idea that education should focus on the historical development of a continually developing common western base of human knowledge and art, the timeless value of classic thought on central human issues by landmark thinkers, and revolutionary ideas critical to historical western [[paradigm shift]]s or changes in world view. A program of studies which is highly general, nonspecialized, and nonvocational is advocated.<ref>Paul D. Travers and Ronald W. Rebore: \\'\\'Foundations of Education, Becoming a Teacher\\'\\', Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1990, p. 66</ref> They firmly believe that exposure of all citizens to the development of thought by those most responsible for the evolution of the Western tradition is integral to the survival of the freedoms, human rights and responsibilities inherent to a true Democracy.  Adler states: <blockquote> ... our political democracy depends upon the reconstitution of our schools. Our schools are not turning out young people prepared for the high office and the duties of citizenship in a democratic republic. Our political institutions cannot thrive, they may not even survive, if we do not produce a greater number of thinking citizens, from whom some statesmen of the type we had in the 18th century might eventually emerge. We are, indeed, a nation at risk, and nothing but radical reform of our schools can save us from impending disaster... Whatever the price... the price we will pay for not doing it will be much greater.<ref>Mortimer J. Adler: Reforming [http://radicalacademy.com/adlerreformedu.htm Education — No Quick Fix], \\'\\'The Radical Academy\\'\\'</ref> </blockquote>  Hutchins writes in the same vein: <blockquote> The business of saying ... that people are not capable of achieving a good education is too strongly reminiscent of the opposition of every extension of democracy. This opposition has always rested on the allegation that the people were incapable of exercising the power they demanded. Always the historic statement has been verified: you cannot expect the slave to show the virtues of the free man unless you first set him free. When the slave has been set free, he has, in the passage of time, become indistinguishable from those who have always been free ... There appears to be an innate human tendency to underestimate the capacity of those who do not belong to \"our\" group. Those who do not share our background cannot have our ability. Foreigners, people who are in a different economic status, and the young seem invariably to be regarded as intellectually backward ...<ref name=\"Hutchins\">Robert Maynard Hutchins: \\'\\'Great Books: The Foundation of a Liberal Education\\'\\', Simon & Schuster, New York, 1954</ref> </blockquote>  As with the [[Educational essentialism|essentialists]], perennialists are educationally conservative in the requirement of a curriculum focused upon fundamental subject areas, but stress that the overall aim should be exposure to history\\'s finest thinkers as models for discovery.  The student should be taught such basic subjects as English, languages, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and fine arts.<ref>George F. Kneller: \\'\\'Introduction to the Philosophy of Education\\'\\', John Wiley & Sons, 1971</ref> Adler states: \"The three R\\'s, which always signified the formal disciplines, are the essence of liberal or general education.\"<ref>Adler: op. cit., p. 62</ref>  Secular perennialists agree with [[Educational progressivism|progressivists]] that memorization of vast amounts of factual information and a focus on second-hand information in textbooks and lectures does not develop rational thought. They advocate learning through the development of meaningful conceptual thinking and judgement by means of a directed reading list of the profound, aesthetic, and meaningful [[great books]] of the [[Western canon]]. These books, secular perennialists argue, are written by the world\\'s finest thinkers, and cumulatively comprise the \"[[Great Conversation]]\" of mankind with regard to the central human questions. Their basic argument for the use of original works (abridged translations being acceptable as well) is that these are the products of \"[[genius]]\". Hutchins remarks:  <blockquote>Great books are great teachers; they are showing us every day what ordinary people are capable of. These books come out of ignorant, inquiring humanity. They are usually the first announcements for success in learning. Most of them were written for, and addressed to, ordinary people.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/></blockquote>  It is important to note that the Great Conversation is not static, which is the impression that one might obtain from some descriptions of perennialism, a confusion with religious perennialism, or even the term perennialism itself.  The Great Conversation and the set of related great books changes as the representative thought of man changes or progresses, and is therefore representative of an evolution of thought, but is not based upon the whim or fancy of the latest cultural fads.  Hutchins makes this point very clear:  <blockquote> In the course of history... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation. ...the West needs to recapture and reemphasize and bring to bear upon its present problems the wisdom that lies in the works of its greatest thinkers and in the discussion that they have carried on.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  Perennialism was a solution proposed in response to what was considered by many to be a failing educational system. Again Hutchins writes:  <blockquote> The products of American high schools are illiterate; and a degree from a famous college or university is no guarantee that the graduate is in any better case. One of the most remarkable features of American society is that the difference between the \"uneducated\" and the \"educated\" is so slight.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  In this regard [[John Dewey]] and Hutchins were in agreement. Hutchins\\'s book \\'\\'The Higher Learning in America\\'\\' deplored the \"plight of higher learning\" that had turned away from cultivation of the intellect and toward anti-intellectual practicality due in part, to a lust for money. In a highly negative review of the book, Dewey wrote a series of articles in \\'\\'The Social Frontier\\'\\' which began by applauding Hutchins\\' attack on \"the aimlessness of our present educational scheme.<ref>Thomas Erlich: \"Dewey versus Hutchins: The Next Round,\" \\'\\'Education and Democracy: Re-imagining Liberal Learning in America\\'\\', ed. Robert Orril, College Entrance Examination Board, New York, 1997</ref>  Perennialists believe that reading is to be supplemented with mutual investigations (between the teacher and the student) and minimally-directed discussions through the [[Socratic method]] in order to develop a historically oriented understanding of concepts. They argue that accurate, independent reasoning distinguishes the developed or educated mind and they thus stress the development of this faculty. A skilled teacher would keep discussions on topic and correct errors in reasoning, but it would be the class, not the teacher, who would reach the conclusions.  While not directing or leading the class to a conclusion, the teacher may work to accurately formulate problems within the scope of the texts being studied.  While the standard argument for utilizing a modern text supports distillation of information into a form relevant to modern society, perennialists argue that many of the historical debates and the development of ideas presented by the great books are relevant to any society, at any time, and thus that the suitability of the great books for instructional use is unaffected by their age.  Perennialists freely acknowledge that any particular selection of great books will disagree on many topics; however, they see this as an advantage, rather than a detriment. They believe that the student must learn to recognize such disagreements, which often reflect current debates. The student becomes responsible for thinking about the disagreements and reaching a reasoned, defensible conclusion. This is a major goal of the Socratic discussions. They do not advocate teaching a settled scholarly interpretation of the books, which would cheat the student of the opportunity to learn rational criticism and to know his own mind.  ==Religious perennialism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of education]] --> Perennialism was originally religious in nature, developed first by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the thirteenth century in his work \\'\\'[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer11.htm De Magistro]\\'\\' (\\'\\'The Teacher\\'\\').  In the nineteenth century, [[John Henry Newman]] presented a detailed defense of educational perennialism in \\'\\'The Idea of a University\\'\\'.  Discourse 5 of that work, \"[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/idea/discourse5.html Knowledge Its Own End]\", is still relevant as a clear statement of a Christian educational perennialism.  There are several epistemological options, which affect the pedagogical options.  The possibilities may be surveyed by considering four extreme positions, as indicated in the following table: {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"25\" cellpadding=\"25\" align=\"center\" |- ! Idealistic Rationalism ! Realistic Rationalism |-  ! Idealistic Fideism ! Realistic Fideism |}  ==Colleges exemplifying this philosophy== * [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] is a well-known secular liberal arts college which requires a year-long humanities course covering ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy. Students may pursue an optional extension to this core curriculum in later years. * [[St. John\\'s College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] is a secular liberal arts college with an undergraduate program described as \"an all-required course of study based on the great books of the Western tradition.\" * The [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] of [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], is another example of a well-known example of educational perennialism.  * The [[University of Chicago]]\\'s Common Core, established by [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] is another well-known example of educational perennialism.

The [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]] officially announced the European Anthem on 19 January 1972 at Strasbourg: the prelude to \"The Ode to Joy\", 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven\\'s 9th symphony. In 1974 the same piece of music was adopted as the [[National Anthem of Rhodesia]].  Conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] was asked to write three instrumental arrangements – for solo piano, for wind instruments and for symphony orchestra and he conducted the performance used to make the official recording. He wrote his decisions on the score, notably those concerning the tempo. Karajan decided on [[Half note|minim]] (half note) = 80 whereas Beethoven had written [[Quarter note|crotchet]] (quarter note) = 120.  The anthem was launched via a major information campaign on [[Europe Day]] in 1972. In 1985, it was adopted by EU heads of State and government as the official anthem of the then European Community – since 1993 the European Union. It is not intended to replace the national anthems of the Member States but rather to celebrate the values they all share and their unity in diversity. It expresses the ideals of a united Europe: freedom, peace, and solidarity.<ref>[http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp Emblems], Council of Europe web site</ref>  ===Recent events=== It was to have been included in the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] along with the other [[European symbols]]; however, the treaty failed ratification and was replaced by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which does not include any symbols.<ref name=\"Parl use\">{{cite web|last=Beunderman|first=Mark|title=MEPs defy member states on EU symbols|publisher=EU Observer|date=11 July 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24464|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> A declaration was attached to the treaty, in which sixteen member states formally recognised the proposed symbols.<ref name=\"lisbon-symbols-declaration\">[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:0231:0271:EN:PDF Official Journal of the European Union, 2007 C 306–2, p. 267]</ref> In response, the [[European Parliament]] decided that it would make greater use of the anthem, for example at official occasions.<ref name=\"Parl use\"/> In October 2008, the Parliament changed its rules of procedure to have the anthem played at the opening of Parliament after elections and at formal sittings.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lucia|last=Kubosova|title=No prolonged mandate for Barroso, MEPs warn|publisher=[[EU Observer]]|date=9 October 2008|url=http://euobserver.com/9/26899|accessdate=2008-10-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081010125604/http://euobserver.com/9/26899| archivedate= 10 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  ==Usage== [[File:Friedrich schiller.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote \\'\\'An die Freude\\'\\' which became the basis for Beethoven\\'s composition.

On 4 October 2010 the anthem was used when a European team beat a team representing the United States of America to win the [[Ryder Cup]] golf tournament. The European Ryder Cup captain [[Colin Montgomerie]] decided to break with tradition and play the European anthem by itself instead of the individual anthems from participating European nations. It was similarly employed at the 2014 Ryder Cup prizegiving ceremony on 28 September, after Europe had beaten America under its captain, [[Paul McGinley]].  \"Ode to Joy\" is used as the theme song to the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|2016 UEFA Euro qualifying]] football competition at the introduction of every match.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fgdXBEhNNc|title = European Qualifiers Intro - UEFA EURO 2016|date = |accessdate = 14 June 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>  \"Ode to Joy\" , automatically orchestrated in seven different styles, has been used on 18 June 2015 during the ceremony celebrating the 5000th ERC grantee as anthem of the [[European Research Council]] to represent achievements of European research.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buXqNqBFd6E|title = Ode to Joy orchestrated in different styles by Flow Machines|date = |accessdate = 23 June 2016|website = YouTube|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>  ==Unofficial lyrics== Due to the large number of languages used in the European Union, the anthem is purely instrumental, and the German lyrics that [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote and on which Beethoven based [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|the melody]] upon have no official status. Despite this, the German lyrics are often sung by choirs or ordinary people when the anthem is played: for example, at the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004 enlargement on the German-Polish border]], the crowd watching the ceremony playing the music sang along with the German lyrics.  Aside from this, several translations of the poem used by Beethoven as well as original works have attempted to provide lyrics to the anthem in various languages. Versions of the anthem including lyrics have been sung outside official EU occasions.  In France, several adaptations of Beethoven\\'s Ode were known long before the onset of European Union. A version by the librettist Maurice Bouchor (1855–1929) entitled \\'\\'Hymn to the Universal Humanity\\'\\' (\\'\\'[[:s:fr:Hymne à l\\'universelle humanité|Hymne à l\\'universelle humanité]]\\'\\') adding several verses to a preceding version of Jean Ruault, was published. This version and another by Maurice Bouchor, published with Julien Thiersot under the title \\'\\'Hymn for future times\\'\\' (\\'\\'Hymne des temps futurs\\'\\') in a music book which was widespread among basic schools,<ref>\\'\\'Chants populaires pour les écoles\\'\\', librairie Hachette, published in several editions between 1902 and 1911</ref> is performed unofficially by school choirs during European events. Another version by the Catholic writer Joseph Folliet (1903–1972) is also known.  ===Ode to Joy original lyrics===  {{Col-float}} :\\'\\'\\'\"An die Freude\"\\'\\'\\' :\\'\\'German lyrics by Friedrich Schiller\\'\\'  {{lang|de|<poem> :Freude schöner Götterfunken :Tochter aus Elysium, :Wir betreten feuertrunken, :Himmlische, dein Heiligtum! :Deine Zauber binden wieder :Was die Mode streng geteilt; :Alle Menschen werden Brüder, :Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.  :Wem der große Wurf gelungen, :Eines Freundes Freund zu sein; :Wer ein holdes Weib errungen, :Mische seinen Jubel ein! :Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele :Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund! :Und wer\\'s nie gekonnt, der stehle :Weinend sich aus diesem Bund!  :Freude trinken alle Wesen :An den Brüsten der Natur; :Alle Guten, alle Bösen :Folgen ihrer Rosenspur. :Küsse gab sie uns und Reben, :Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod; :Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben, :und der Cherub steht vor Gott.  :Froh, :wie seine Sonnen fliegen :Durch des Himmels prächt\\'gen Plan, :Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn, :Freudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen.  :Seid umschlungen, Millionen! :Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt! :Brüder, über\\'m Sternenzelt :Muß ein lieber Vater wohnen. :Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen? :Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt? :Such\\' ihn über\\'m Sternenzelt! :Über Sternen muß er wohnen. </poem>}}  {{Col-float-break}}  :\\'\\'\\'\"Ode to Joy\"\\'\\'\\' :\\'\\'Translation in English\\'\\'  <poem> :Joy, bright spark of divinity, :Daughter of Elysium, :Fire-inspired we tread, :Thy Heavenly, thy sanctuary. :Thy magic power re-unites :All that custom has divided, :All men become brothers :Under the sway of thy gentle wings.  :Whoever has created  :An abiding friendship, :Or has won a true and loving wife, :Join in our song of praise, :Yes, all who can call at least one soul  :Theirs upon this earth; :But any who cannot must creep tearfully :Away from our circle.  :All creatures drink of joy :At nature\\'s breast. :Just and unjust :Alike taste of her gift; :She gave us kisses and the fruit of the vine, :A tried friend to the end. :Even the worm can feel contentment, :And the cherub stands before God!  :Gladly,  :As His heavenly bodies fly :On their courses through the heavens, :Thus, brothers, you should run your race, :As a hero going to conquest.  :You millions, I embrace you. :This kiss is for all the world! :Brothers, above the starry canopy :There must dwell a loving Father. :Do you fall in worship, you millions? :World, do you know your creator? :Seek him in the heavens; :Above the stars must He dwell. </poem> {{Col-float-end}}  ==See also== * [[National symbols]] * [[European symbols]] ** [[Flag of Europe]]  ==Notes== {{Reflist|2}}  ==External links== {{Wikisource|Ode to Joy}} {{Commons category|Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)}} * [http://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/078124.html Beethoven\\'s Ninth: A Political History], Esteban Buch (Trans.

       "    '{{tone|date=March 2012}} [[Perennialist]]s believe that one should teach the things that one deems to be of everlasting pertinence to all people everywhere. They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques. Since people are people first, and workers second if at all, one should teach liberal topics first, not vocational topics.  A particular strategy with modern perennialists is to teach scientific reasoning, not facts. They may illustrate the reasoning with original accounts of famous experiments. This gives the students a human side to the science, and shows the reasoning in action. Most importantly, it shows the uncertainty and false steps of real science.  Although perennialism may appear similar to [[educational essentialism|essentialism]], perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based. Both philosophies are typically considered to be [[teacher]]-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as [[educational progressivism|progressivism]]. However, since the teachers associated with perennialism are in a sense the authors of the Western masterpieces themselves, these teachers may be open to student criticism through the associated [[Socratic method]], which, if carried out as true dialogue, is a balance between students, including the teacher promoting the discussion.  ==Secular perennialism== The word perennial in secular perennialism suggests something that lasts an indefinitely long time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. As promoted primarily by [[Robert Hutchins]] and [[Mortimer Adler]], a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings is recommended.  This form of perennialism comprises the [[Humanism|humanist]] and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the [[University of Chicago]], where they still strongly influence the curriculum in the form of the undergraduate Common Core.  Other notable figures in the movement include [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] (who together initiated the [[Great Books]] program at [[St. John\\'s College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John\\'s College]] in Annapolis, Maryland), [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Alexander Meiklejohn]], and Sir [[Richard Livingstone]], an English [[Classicism|classicist]] with an American following.  Secular perennialists espouse the idea that education should focus on the historical development of a continually developing common western base of human knowledge and art, the timeless value of classic thought on central human issues by landmark thinkers, and revolutionary ideas critical to historical western [[paradigm shift]]s or changes in world view. A program of studies which is highly general, nonspecialized, and nonvocational is advocated.<ref>Paul D. Travers and Ronald W. Rebore: \\'\\'Foundations of Education, Becoming a Teacher\\'\\', Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1990, p. 66</ref> They firmly believe that exposure of all citizens to the development of thought by those most responsible for the evolution of the Western tradition is integral to the survival of the freedoms, human rights and responsibilities inherent to a true Democracy.  Adler states: <blockquote> ... our political democracy depends upon the reconstitution of our schools. Our schools are not turning out young people prepared for the high office and the duties of citizenship in a democratic republic. Our political institutions cannot thrive, they may not even survive, if we do not produce a greater number of thinking citizens, from whom some statesmen of the type we had in the 18th century might eventually emerge. We are, indeed, a nation at risk, and nothing but radical reform of our schools can save us from impending disaster... Whatever the price... the price we will pay for not doing it will be much greater.<ref>Mortimer J. Adler: Reforming [http://radicalacademy.com/adlerreformedu.htm Education — No Quick Fix], \\'\\'The Radical Academy\\'\\'</ref> </blockquote>  Hutchins writes in the same vein: <blockquote> The business of saying ... that people are not capable of achieving a good education is too strongly reminiscent of the opposition of every extension of democracy. This opposition has always rested on the allegation that the people were incapable of exercising the power they demanded. Always the historic statement has been verified: you cannot expect the slave to show the virtues of the free man unless you first set him free. When the slave has been set free, he has, in the passage of time, become indistinguishable from those who have always been free ... There appears to be an innate human tendency to underestimate the capacity of those who do not belong to \"our\" group. Those who do not share our background cannot have our ability. Foreigners, people who are in a different economic status, and the young seem invariably to be regarded as intellectually backward ...<ref name=\"Hutchins\">Robert Maynard Hutchins: \\'\\'Great Books: The Foundation of a Liberal Education\\'\\', Simon & Schuster, New York, 1954</ref> </blockquote>  As with the [[Educational essentialism|essentialists]], perennialists are educationally conservative in the requirement of a curriculum focused upon fundamental subject areas, but stress that the overall aim should be exposure to history\\'s finest thinkers as models for discovery.  The student should be taught such basic subjects as English, languages, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and fine arts.<ref>George F. Kneller: \\'\\'Introduction to the Philosophy of Education\\'\\', John Wiley & Sons, 1971</ref> Adler states: \"The three R\\'s, which always signified the formal disciplines, are the essence of liberal or general education.\"<ref>Adler: op. cit., p. 62</ref>  Secular perennialists agree with [[Educational progressivism|progressivists]] that memorization of vast amounts of factual information and a focus on second-hand information in textbooks and lectures does not develop rational thought. They advocate learning through the development of meaningful conceptual thinking and judgement by means of a directed reading list of the profound, aesthetic, and meaningful [[great books]] of the [[Western canon]]. These books, secular perennialists argue, are written by the world\\'s finest thinkers, and cumulatively comprise the \"[[Great Conversation]]\" of mankind with regard to the central human questions. Their basic argument for the use of original works (abridged translations being acceptable as well) is that these are the products of \"[[genius]]\". Hutchins remarks:  <blockquote>Great books are great teachers; they are showing us every day what ordinary people are capable of. These books come out of ignorant, inquiring humanity. They are usually the first announcements for success in learning. Most of them were written for, and addressed to, ordinary people.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/></blockquote>  It is important to note that the Great Conversation is not static, which is the impression that one might obtain from some descriptions of perennialism, a confusion with religious perennialism, or even the term perennialism itself.  The Great Conversation and the set of related great books changes as the representative thought of man changes or progresses, and is therefore representative of an evolution of thought, but is not based upon the whim or fancy of the latest cultural fads.  Hutchins makes this point very clear:  <blockquote> In the course of history... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation. ...the West needs to recapture and reemphasize and bring to bear upon its present problems the wisdom that lies in the works of its greatest thinkers and in the discussion that they have carried on.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  Perennialism was a solution proposed in response to what was considered by many to be a failing educational system. Again Hutchins writes:  <blockquote> The products of American high schools are illiterate; and a degree from a famous college or university is no guarantee that the graduate is in any better case. One of the most remarkable features of American society is that the difference between the \"uneducated\" and the \"educated\" is so slight.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  In this regard [[John Dewey]] and Hutchins were in agreement. Hutchins\\'s book \\'\\'The Higher Learning in America\\'\\' deplored the \"plight of higher learning\" that had turned away from cultivation of the intellect and toward anti-intellectual practicality due in part, to a lust for money. In a highly negative review of the book, Dewey wrote a series of articles in \\'\\'The Social Frontier\\'\\' which began by applauding Hutchins\\' attack on \"the aimlessness of our present educational scheme.<ref>Thomas Erlich: \"Dewey versus Hutchins: The Next Round,\" \\'\\'Education and Democracy: Re-imagining Liberal Learning in America\\'\\', ed. Robert Orril, College Entrance Examination Board, New York, 1997</ref>  Perennialists believe that reading is to be supplemented with mutual investigations (between the teacher and the student) and minimally-directed discussions through the [[Socratic method]] in order to develop a historically oriented understanding of concepts. They argue that accurate, independent reasoning distinguishes the developed or educated mind and they thus stress the development of this faculty. A skilled teacher would keep discussions on topic and correct errors in reasoning, but it would be the class, not the teacher, who would reach the conclusions.  While not directing or leading the class to a conclusion, the teacher may work to accurately formulate problems within the scope of the texts being studied.  While the standard argument for utilizing a modern text supports distillation of information into a form relevant to modern society, perennialists argue that many of the historical debates and the development of ideas presented by the great books are relevant to any society, at any time, and thus that the suitability of the great books for instructional use is unaffected by their age.  Perennialists freely acknowledge that any particular selection of great books will disagree on many topics; however, they see this as an advantage, rather than a detriment. They believe that the student must learn to recognize such disagreements, which often reflect current debates. The student becomes responsible for thinking about the disagreements and reaching a reasoned, defensible conclusion. This is a major goal of the Socratic discussions. They do not advocate teaching a settled scholarly interpretation of the books, which would cheat the student of the opportunity to learn rational criticism and to know his own mind.  ==Religious perennialism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of education]] --> Perennialism was originally religious in nature, developed first by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the thirteenth century in his work \\'\\'[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer11.htm De Magistro]\\'\\' (\\'\\'The Teacher\\'\\').  In the nineteenth century, [[John Henry Newman]] presented a detailed defense of educational perennialism in \\'\\'The Idea of a University\\'\\'.  Discourse 5 of that work, \"[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/idea/discourse5.html Knowledge Its Own End]\", is still relevant as a clear statement of a Christian educational perennialism.  There are several epistemological options, which affect the pedagogical options.  The possibilities may be surveyed by considering four extreme positions, as indicated in the following table: {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"25\" cellpadding=\"25\" align=\"center\" |- !

The [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]] officially announced the European Anthem on 19 January 1972 at Strasbourg: the prelude to \"The Ode to Joy\", 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven\\'s 9th symphony. In 1974 the same piece of music was adopted as the [[National Anthem of Rhodesia]].  Conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] was asked to write three instrumental arrangements – for solo piano, for wind instruments and for symphony orchestra and he conducted the performance used to make the official recording. He wrote his decisions on the score, notably those concerning the tempo. Karajan decided on [[Half note|minim]] (half note) = 80 whereas Beethoven had written [[Quarter note|crotchet]] (quarter note) = 120.  The anthem was launched via a major information campaign on [[Europe Day]] in 1972. In 1985, it was adopted by EU heads of State and government as the official anthem of the then European Community – since 1993 the European Union. It is not intended to replace the national anthems of the Member States but rather to celebrate the values they all share and their unity in diversity. It expresses the ideals of a united Europe: freedom, peace, and solidarity.<ref>[http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp Emblems], Council of Europe web site</ref>  ===Recent events=== It was to have been included in the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] along with the other [[European symbols]]; however, the treaty failed ratification and was replaced by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which does not include any symbols.<ref name=\"Parl use\">{{cite web|last=Beunderman|first=Mark|title=MEPs defy member states on EU symbols|publisher=EU Observer|date=11 July 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24464|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> A declaration was attached to the treaty, in which sixteen member states formally recognised the proposed symbols.<ref name=\"lisbon-symbols-declaration\">[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:0231:0271:EN:PDF Official Journal of the European Union, 2007 C 306–2, p. 267]</ref> In response, the [[European Parliament]] decided that it would make greater use of the anthem, for example at official occasions.<ref name=\"Parl use\"/> In October 2008, the Parliament changed its rules of procedure to have the anthem played at the opening of Parliament after elections and at formal sittings.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lucia|last=Kubosova|title=No prolonged mandate for Barroso, MEPs warn|publisher=[[EU Observer]]|date=9 October 2008|url=http://euobserver.com/9/26899|accessdate=2008-10-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081010125604/http://euobserver.com/9/26899| archivedate= 10 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  ==Usage== [[File:Friedrich schiller.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote \\'\\'An die Freude\\'\\' which became the basis for Beethoven\\'s composition.

Despite this, the German lyrics are often sung by choirs or ordinary people when the anthem is played: for example, at the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004 enlargement on the German-Polish border]], the crowd watching the ceremony playing the music sang along with the German lyrics.  Aside from this, several translations of the poem used by Beethoven as well as original works have attempted to provide lyrics to the anthem in various languages. Versions of the anthem including lyrics have been sung outside official EU occasions.  In France, several adaptations of Beethoven\\'s Ode were known long before the onset of European Union. A version by the librettist Maurice Bouchor (1855–1929) entitled \\'\\'Hymn to the Universal Humanity\\'\\' (\\'\\'[[:s:fr:Hymne à l\\'universelle humanité|Hymne à l\\'universelle humanité]]\\'\\') adding several verses to a preceding version of Jean Ruault, was published. This version and another by Maurice Bouchor, published with Julien Thiersot under the title \\'\\'Hymn for future times\\'\\' (\\'\\'Hymne des temps futurs\\'\\') in a music book which was widespread among basic schools,<ref>\\'\\'Chants populaires pour les écoles\\'\\', librairie Hachette, published in several editions between 1902 and 1911</ref> is performed unofficially by school choirs during European events. Another version by the Catholic writer Joseph Folliet (1903–1972) is also known.  ===Ode to Joy original lyrics===  {{Col-float}} :\\'\\'\\'\"An die Freude\"\\'\\'\\' :\\'\\'German lyrics by Friedrich Schiller\\'\\'  {{lang|de|<poem> :Freude schöner Götterfunken :Tochter aus Elysium, :Wir betreten feuertrunken, :Himmlische, dein Heiligtum! :Deine Zauber binden wieder :Was die Mode streng geteilt; :Alle Menschen werden Brüder, :Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.  :Wem der große Wurf gelungen, :Eines Freundes Freund zu sein; :Wer ein holdes Weib errungen, :Mische seinen Jubel ein! :Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele :Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund! :Und wer\\'s nie gekonnt, der stehle :Weinend sich aus diesem Bund!  :Freude trinken alle Wesen :An den Brüsten der Natur; :Alle Guten, alle Bösen :Folgen ihrer Rosenspur. :Küsse gab sie uns und Reben, :Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod; :Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben, :und der Cherub steht vor Gott.  :Froh, :wie seine Sonnen fliegen :Durch des Himmels prächt\\'gen Plan, :Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn, :Freudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen.  :Seid umschlungen, Millionen! :Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt! :Brüder, über\\'m Sternenzelt :Muß ein lieber Vater wohnen. :Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen? :Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt? :Such\\' ihn über\\'m Sternenzelt! :Über Sternen muß er wohnen. </poem>}}  {{Col-float-break}}  :\\'\\'\\'\"Ode to Joy\"\\'\\'\\' :\\'\\'Translation in English\\'\\'  <poem> :Joy, bright spark of divinity, :Daughter of Elysium, :Fire-inspired we tread, :Thy Heavenly, thy sanctuary. :Thy magic power re-unites :All that custom has divided, :All men become brothers :Under the sway of thy gentle wings.  :Whoever has created  :An abiding friendship, :Or has won a true and loving wife, :Join in our song of praise, :Yes, all who can call at least one soul  :Theirs upon this earth; :But any who cannot must creep tearfully :Away from our circle.  :All creatures drink of joy :At nature\\'s breast. :Just and unjust :Alike taste of her gift; :She gave us kisses and the fruit of the vine, :A tried friend to the end. :Even the worm can feel contentment, :And the cherub stands before God!  :Gladly,  :As His heavenly bodies fly :On their courses through the heavens, :Thus, brothers, you should run your race, :As a hero going to conquest.  :You millions, I embrace you. :This kiss is for all the world! :Brothers, above the starry canopy :There must dwell a loving Father. :Do you fall in worship, you millions? :World, do you know your creator? :Seek him in the heavens; :Above the stars must He dwell. </poem> {{Col-float-end}}  ==See also== * [[National symbols]] * [[European symbols]] ** [[Flag of Europe]]  ==Notes== {{Reflist|2}}  ==External links== {{Wikisource|Ode to Joy}} {{Commons category|Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)}} * [http://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/078124.html Beethoven\\'s Ninth: A Political History], Esteban Buch (Trans.

They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques. Since people are people first, and workers second if at all, one should teach liberal topics first, not vocational topics.  A particular strategy with modern perennialists is to teach scientific reasoning, not facts. They may illustrate the reasoning with original accounts of famous experiments. This gives the students a human side to the science, and shows the reasoning in action. Most importantly, it shows the uncertainty and false steps of real science.  Although perennialism may appear similar to [[educational essentialism|essentialism]], perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based. Both philosophies are typically considered to be [[teacher]]-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as [[educational progressivism|progressivism]]. However, since the teachers associated with perennialism are in a sense the authors of the Western masterpieces themselves, these teachers may be open to student criticism through the associated [[Socratic method]], which, if carried out as true dialogue, is a balance between students, including the teacher promoting the discussion.  ==Secular perennialism== The word perennial in secular perennialism suggests something that lasts an indefinitely long time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. As promoted primarily by [[Robert Hutchins]] and [[Mortimer Adler]], a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings is recommended.  This form of perennialism comprises the [[Humanism|humanist]] and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the [[University of Chicago]], where they still strongly influence the curriculum in the form of the undergraduate Common Core.  Other notable figures in the movement include [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] (who together initiated the [[Great Books]] program at [[St. John\\'s College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John\\'s College]] in Annapolis, Maryland), [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Alexander Meiklejohn]], and Sir [[Richard Livingstone]], an English [[Classicism|classicist]] with an American following.  Secular perennialists espouse the idea that education should focus on the historical development of a continually developing common western base of human knowledge and art, the timeless value of classic thought on central human issues by landmark thinkers, and revolutionary ideas critical to historical western [[paradigm shift]]s or changes in world view. A program of studies which is highly general, nonspecialized, and nonvocational is advocated.<ref>Paul D. Travers and Ronald W. Rebore: \\'\\'Foundations of Education, Becoming a Teacher\\'\\', Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1990, p. 66</ref> They firmly believe that exposure of all citizens to the development of thought by those most responsible for the evolution of the Western tradition is integral to the survival of the freedoms, human rights and responsibilities inherent to a true Democracy.  Adler states: <blockquote> ... our political democracy depends upon the reconstitution of our schools. Our schools are not turning out young people prepared for the high office and the duties of citizenship in a democratic republic. Our political institutions cannot thrive, they may not even survive, if we do not produce a greater number of thinking citizens, from whom some statesmen of the type we had in the 18th century might eventually emerge. We are, indeed, a nation at risk, and nothing but radical reform of our schools can save us from impending disaster... Whatever the price... the price we will pay for not doing it will be much greater.<ref>Mortimer J. Adler: Reforming [http://radicalacademy.com/adlerreformedu.htm Education — No Quick Fix], \\'\\'The Radical Academy\\'\\'</ref> </blockquote>  Hutchins writes in the same vein: <blockquote> The business of saying ... that people are not capable of achieving a good education is too strongly reminiscent of the opposition of every extension of democracy. This opposition has always rested on the allegation that the people were incapable of exercising the power they demanded. Always the historic statement has been verified: you cannot expect the slave to show the virtues of the free man unless you first set him free. When the slave has been set free, he has, in the passage of time, become indistinguishable from those who have always been free ... There appears to be an innate human tendency to underestimate the capacity of those who do not belong to \"our\" group. Those who do not share our background cannot have our ability. Foreigners, people who are in a different economic status, and the young seem invariably to be regarded as intellectually backward ...<ref name=\"Hutchins\">Robert Maynard Hutchins: \\'\\'Great Books: The Foundation of a Liberal Education\\'\\', Simon & Schuster, New York, 1954</ref> </blockquote>  As with the [[Educational essentialism|essentialists]], perennialists are educationally conservative in the requirement of a curriculum focused upon fundamental subject areas, but stress that the overall aim should be exposure to history\\'s finest thinkers as models for discovery.  The student should be taught such basic subjects as English, languages, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and fine arts.<ref>George F. Kneller: \\'\\'Introduction to the Philosophy of Education\\'\\', John Wiley & Sons, 1971</ref> Adler states: \"The three R\\'s, which always signified the formal disciplines, are the essence of liberal or general education.\"<ref>Adler: op. cit., p. 62</ref>  Secular perennialists agree with [[Educational progressivism|progressivists]] that memorization of vast amounts of factual information and a focus on second-hand information in textbooks and lectures does not develop rational thought. They advocate learning through the development of meaningful conceptual thinking and judgement by means of a directed reading list of the profound, aesthetic, and meaningful [[great books]] of the [[Western canon]]. These books, secular perennialists argue, are written by the world\\'s finest thinkers, and cumulatively comprise the \"[[Great Conversation]]\" of mankind with regard to the central human questions. Their basic argument for the use of original works (abridged translations being acceptable as well) is that these are the products of \"[[genius]]\". Hutchins remarks:  <blockquote>Great books are great teachers; they are showing us every day what ordinary people are capable of. These books come out of ignorant, inquiring humanity. They are usually the first announcements for success in learning. Most of them were written for, and addressed to, ordinary people.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/></blockquote>  It is important to note that the Great Conversation is not static, which is the impression that one might obtain from some descriptions of perennialism, a confusion with religious perennialism, or even the term perennialism itself.  The Great Conversation and the set of related great books changes as the representative thought of man changes or progresses, and is therefore representative of an evolution of thought, but is not based upon the whim or fancy of the latest cultural fads.  Hutchins makes this point very clear:  <blockquote> In the course of history... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation. ...the West needs to recapture and reemphasize and bring to bear upon its present problems the wisdom that lies in the works of its greatest thinkers and in the discussion that they have carried on.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  Perennialism was a solution proposed in response to what was considered by many to be a failing educational system. Again Hutchins writes:  <blockquote> The products of American high schools are illiterate; and a degree from a famous college or university is no guarantee that the graduate is in any better case. One of the most remarkable features of American society is that the difference between the \"uneducated\" and the \"educated\" is so slight.<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/> </blockquote>  In this regard [[John Dewey]] and Hutchins were in agreement. Hutchins\\'s book \\'\\'The Higher Learning in America\\'\\' deplored the \"plight of higher learning\" that had turned away from cultivation of the intellect and toward anti-intellectual practicality due in part, to a lust for money. In a highly negative review of the book, Dewey wrote a series of articles in \\'\\'The Social Frontier\\'\\' which began by applauding Hutchins\\' attack on \"the aimlessness of our present educational scheme.<ref>Thomas Erlich: \"Dewey versus Hutchins: The Next Round,\" \\'\\'Education and Democracy: Re-imagining Liberal Learning in America\\'\\', ed. Robert Orril, College Entrance Examination Board, New York, 1997</ref>  Perennialists believe that reading is to be supplemented with mutual investigations (between the teacher and the student) and minimally-directed discussions through the [[Socratic method]] in order to develop a historically oriented understanding of concepts. They argue that accurate, independent reasoning distinguishes the developed or educated mind and they thus stress the development of this faculty. A skilled teacher would keep discussions on topic and correct errors in reasoning, but it would be the class, not the teacher, who would reach the conclusions.  While not directing or leading the class to a conclusion, the teacher may work to accurately formulate problems within the scope of the texts being studied.  While the standard argument for utilizing a modern text supports distillation of information into a form relevant to modern society, perennialists argue that many of the historical debates and the development of ideas presented by the great books are relevant to any society, at any time, and thus that the suitability of the great books for instructional use is unaffected by their age.  Perennialists freely acknowledge that any particular selection of great books will disagree on many topics; however, they see this as an advantage, rather than a detriment. They believe that the student must learn to recognize such disagreements, which often reflect current debates. The student becomes responsible for thinking about the disagreements and reaching a reasoned, defensible conclusion. This is a major goal of the Socratic discussions. They do not advocate teaching a settled scholarly interpretation of the books, which would cheat the student of the opportunity to learn rational criticism and to know his own mind.  ==Religious perennialism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of education]] --> Perennialism was originally religious in nature, developed first by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the thirteenth century in his work \\'\\'[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer11.htm De Magistro]\\'\\' (\\'\\'The Teacher\\'\\').  In the nineteenth century, [[John Henry Newman]] presented a detailed defense of educational perennialism in \\'\\'The Idea of a University\\'\\'.  Discourse 5 of that work, \"[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/idea/discourse5.html Knowledge Its Own End]\", is still relevant as a clear statement of a Christian educational perennialism.  There are several epistemological options, which affect the pedagogical options.  The possibilities may be surveyed by considering four extreme positions, as indicated in the following table: {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"25\" cellpadding=\"25\" align=\"center\" |- ! Idealistic Rationalism ! Realistic Rationalism |-  ! Idealistic Fideism ! Realistic Fideism |}  ==Colleges exemplifying this philosophy== * [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] is a well-known secular liberal arts college which requires a year-long humanities course covering ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy. Students may pursue an optional extension to this core curriculum in later years. * [[St. John\\'s College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] is a secular liberal arts college with an undergraduate program described as \"an all-required course of study based on the great books of the Western tradition.\" * The [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] of [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], is another example of a well-known example of educational perennialism.  * The [[University of Chicago]]\\'s Common Core, established by [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] is another well-known example of educational perennialism. Similar to [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], it is an uncommon example of an educational perennialistic college within a large research institution.  * Integral Program at [[Saint Mary\\'s College of California]] in [http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/academics/undergraduate/programs_by_school/school_of_liberal_arts/programs/integral/] is a [[Great Books]] major at the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Lasallian]] Catholic liberal arts college in [[Moraga, California]]. The program was designed with the assistance of faculty from St. John\\'s College, U.S. * [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in [[Santa Paula, California]] is a Catholic Christian college with a Great Books curriculum. The college was founded by a group of graduates and professors of the Integral Program at Saint Mary\\'s College of California, who were discouraged by the liberalism that became common place among the faculty and administration on Saint Mary\\'s campus shortly after [[Vatican II]]. * [[Gutenberg College]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]] provides \"a broad-based liberal arts education in a Protestant Christian environment\", with a \"great books\" curriculum emphasizing \"the development of basic learning skills (reading, writing, mathematics, and critical thinking) and the application of these skills to profound writings of the past\" * [[Shimer College]] in [[Chicago]] grants a Bachelor of Arts to students who complete a program composed of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, integrative studies and a capstone senior thesis. * The Torrey Honors Institute at [[Biola University]] is a Christian Great Books program. * [[George Wythe University]] in [[Cedar City, Utah]], is an unaccredited [[liberal arts]] school. * [http://www.thomasmorecollege.edu/ Thomas More College] in Merrimack, New Hampshire is a Catholic College with an integrated [http://www.thomasmorecollege.edu/academics/course-descriptions/ Liberal Arts curriculum].
